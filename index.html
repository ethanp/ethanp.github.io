  <div class="entry-content"><p>When looking into what Cassandra and HBase are, and their relative strengths
and weaknesses, people often seem to think they can get away with the
following very succinct characterizations: &ldquo;Cassandra is like is Dynamo plus
Bigtable, and HBase is just Bigtable&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know much about Dynamo <em>or</em>
BigTable because we skipped those papers in my systems courses. So to get
started understanding what&rsquo;s going on with all this mess, I decided to read
the Bigtable paper. What follows is a brief summarization/retelling of the
<a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf">Bigtable paper</a>. It follows roughly the form of the paper, especially in
that it starts high level, and then digs slightly lower-down into the
implementation. It contains basically only and all of the parts of the paper
that I found illuminating, but broken down into sentences that are hopefully
easier to understand.</p>

<h3>What problem are we solving?</h3>

<p>Bigtable provides an API for storing and retrieving data.</p>

<p>It is most useful if</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a <em>lot</em> of data coming in at a high rate over time</li>
<li>there is no need to join each data table with another</li>
<li>data might need to be updated</li>
<li>range queries are common</li>
</ul>


<p>Bigtable is a distributed database. It is a database management system which
allows you to define tables, write and update data, and run queries against
the stored data. It is similar to a relational database, except that it is not
&ldquo;relational&rdquo; in the sense denoted by the term &ldquo;relational database&rdquo;. Instead,
it brings its own type of data model, where instead of storing data in normal
two-dimensional table cells, you store it according to a new set of rules that
allows for flexibility in the shape of each record, while still enabling
overall efficiency.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>What is a server and how does it relate to my Rails app?</h1>

<p>I learned the basics of Ruby on Rails web application development a few years
ago. At that time, my understanding how that system works was as follows</p>

<ol>
<li>Find articles describing things Rails allows you to do easily</li>
<li>Decide on an app that requires only those things</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in those articles to implement your app idea</li>
<li>Push the app to Heroku</li>
<li>Now the app is accessible to anyone on the World Wide Web</li>
</ol>


<p>The fact that it is <em>so</em> easy to do such a thing is nothing short of magical.
Especially while you have <em>no idea</em> how any of it works. Now that I am
slightly more knowledgeable about how software systems are put together and
deployed, I&rsquo;d like to take a slightly more nuanced stab at what really was
going on when the above 5 steps were executed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>SSH Tunneling</h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;Tunnelling&rdquo;, with two ells, is the British spelling.</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, I downloaded a tool (an ELK stack) that didn&rsquo;t work right
off the bat due to some sort of misconfiguration. It was running in a Vagrant-
made virtual machine (VM) on my laptop. The Vagrant setup script had forwarded
a local port on my laptop into the VM. So in order to debug it, my coworker
configured a chain of tunnels that enabled him to SSH into the VM on my
laptop.</p>

<p>In the back of my mind, I spent the next few weeks trying to figure out what
SSH port-forwarding is and how its syntax works, then another few weeks to
figure out what reverse port-forwarding is, and another few weeks to find
practical use-cases for each.</p>

<p>Here is my executive summary</p>

<pre><code>ssh -L [&lt;localhost&gt;:]&lt;localport&gt;:&lt;remotehost&gt;:&lt;remoteport&gt; &lt;gateway&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By default, <code>&lt;localhost&gt;</code> will be <code>localhost</code>.</p>

<p>What this does is, start a serversocket listening to local address
<code>localhost:localport</code> using the &ldquo;SSH client&rdquo;. When a client establishes a
connection to that address, traffic received from that client will be
encrypted, and forwarded to the <code>sshd</code>[aemon] listening on port 22 of
<code>gateway</code>. (Only) after the gateway receives this traffic, the <code>sshd</code> will
establish a (normal, unencrypted) connection to remote address
<code>remotehost:remoteport</code>, and forward the data originally received by the SSH
client there. Response traffic originating from <code>remotehost:remoteport</code> will
go back to the <code>sshd</code>, back through the encrypted tunnel to the SSH client,
and back to the originating client.</p>

<p><em>Reverse</em> tunneling by contrast, means that traffic <em>originating</em> on the
remote end will be forwarded to the local end.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s SSH</h2>

<p>One thing that confused me about SSH forwarding, is that if I don&rsquo;t use some
extra flags to disable it, when I set up port forwarding to a another machine,
I also end up with a shell ready executing commands remotely. What is going on
here? It turns out it is doing what is called &ldquo;remote command execution&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of what I&rsquo;ve learned and discussed here comes from <em>TCP/IP Sockets in
Java</em>, a highly recommended book about this stuff by Calvert and Donahoo. Some
of it also comes from <em>Java Network Programming</em> by Elliotte Rusty Harold.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <em>only</em> transport-layer protocols Java supports are TCP &amp; UDP; for
anything else, you must link to native code via the Java Native Interface</li>
<li>TCP uses <em>stream</em> sockets, through which one generally just writes to an
<code>OutputStream</code> and reads from an <code>InputStream</code> of bytes that remain in-order
and uncorrupted and are (practically) guaranteed delivery by the
implementation of the protocol by the operating system.

<ul>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;re using NIO; see below for more on that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UDP uses <em>datagram</em> sockets, through which you <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> objects
called <code>DatagramPacket</code>s, which are just a length, a destination, and data</li>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;re using NIO, everything <em>blocks</em>: e.g. connecting to servers,
listening for clients, reads, writes, and disconnecting (for TCP)

<ul>
<li>By default most of these actions may block <em>indefinitely</em></li>
<li>For reading and connecting, you can configure a timeout, after which you
will receive an <code>InterruptedIOException</code></li>
<li>For <em>writing</em> to a TCP stream, you <em>cannot</em> configure a timeout</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Handling multiple clients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Deal with one at a time, which is simplest, especially if there&rsquo;s some state
that is shared by all potential clients. Speed may become problematic
quickly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Use NIO (rather complicated) to allow <code>N</code> threads to service <code>M</code>
clients, where <code>N</code> is small and <code>M</code> is huge. This uses event-based
programming. We can set all network operations to be non-blocking, and
only wait as long as we want to for them. An extensive example can be
found below.</li>
<li>Use a framework like Netty, Akka, etc. that wraps the NIO stuff up in a
ribbon and a tie</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are many circumstances in life during which one may feel the need to ask
for advice. For example, when evaluating a significant decision, or when
dealing with an emotionally stressful circumstance. Here, I will discuss
advice about significant decisions.</p>

<p>In giving advice, everyone has a different approach. I generally try to follow
a line I heard in a rap song by The Streets, &ldquo;If you never tell a lie to her,
you don&rsquo;t have to remember anything.&rdquo; In other words, lying will only
complicate your life because you have to remember the lies you made up.
(Caveat: this may not always the best way to go for emotionally complex
issues.) I also enjoy helping people rationally and realistically evaluate
their options for significant decisions, and surely if someone recalls that
your input was helpful in the past, they will be more likely to ask you in the
future.</p>

<p>Most people I know don&rsquo;t seem to like giving useful advice. It seems they
either are (1) too afraid that their honesty will lead you to dislike them, or
(2) they feel so stressed with their own issues that taking on yours for a few
minutes would be overwhelming, or (3) they find your problem uninteresting and
simply have better things to do.</p>

<p>But some people are the opposite. They will patiently listen to your question
and give what they feel to be an honest evaluation of where you stand and what
you should do. The advice of people in this category will often be heavily and
obviously biased by their own experience and ideology. This is simply a
symptom of &ldquo;being honest&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So if you want good advice, it would be ideal to find someone who is honest,
not stressed about a similar problem to yours, as well as interested in and
knowledgeable of the subject; they should generally also be disinterested in
your particular problem. However, this ideal candidate is not always
available.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, hot-shot investor Paul Graham wrote a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html">piece about economic
inequality</a>. This essay provoked a lot of dialogue online. I read the
piece, and a few responses to it. I enjoyed the essay, and I found it very
persuasive. In fact, I would say my &lsquo;opinion on the matter&rsquo; has been changed by
reading the essay and its accompanying summary by the author. The responses I
read were also very interesting. They were from seemingly center-left-wing
individuals like myself, only they were <em>not</em> persuaded by Graham&rsquo;s arguments.</p>

<p>My point here is not so much to discuss the piece, as the tone of the piece.
This piece was written with a tone that raises the hair on the back of the
necks of liberals. This may have been unintentional on the part of Graham,
&hellip;although considering the follow-up discussions of his previous piece on
females in tech, may he just likes raising those particular hairs (they&rsquo;re
called &ldquo;hackles&rdquo;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have spent the last few days trying to get better at programming. I am no
longer in school, so if I want to learn about, say, compilers, I can&rsquo;t just
sign up for a class on that. There are multiple ways to go about it. It depends
on what you really want to learn and what you want to be able to do with that
knowledge. I have tried various methods of learning over the past few days,
which I have listed below.</p>

<p>What I have noticed of myself is that gamification <strong>works</strong> for me. I love the
satisfaction of (in descending order of [perceived] satisfaction)</p>

<ul>
<li>earning a badge</li>
<li>getting to the next level</li>
<li>beating other humans (directly, or via &ldquo;percentile&rdquo; calculation)</li>
<li>beating robots (similar to &ldquo;beating a boss&rdquo; in a video game)</li>
<li>getting points</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am close to two chapters into &ldquo;Compilers&rdquo; (a.k.a. &ldquo;The Dragon Book&rdquo;), by Aho,
Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. It is an exciting topic to learn about.</p>

<p>The most fundamental thing I have learned so far is the overall pipeline for
understanding the modular components forming the way a compiler is typically
constructed. It goes</p>

<ol>
<li>Lexical analyzer</li>
<li>Syntax analyzer</li>
<li>Semantic analyzer</li>
<li>Intermediate code generator</li>
<li><em>Machine-independent code optimizer</em> (optional)</li>
<li>Code generator</li>
<li><em>Machine-dependent code optimizer</em> (optional)</li>
</ol>


<p>The input to the compiler pipeline is a &ldquo;character stream&rdquo; of the program.
However I don&rsquo;t recall the book ever dealing with specifications of that
stream, except that it supports a generic <code>getchar()</code> operation. I can
understand that if the entire source consists of one file, you just read
character-by-character from the file into the compiler. Maybe the language
designer decides how multiple-file projects are to be read by the compiler,
i.e. it is beyond the scope of this book; or maybe they&rsquo;ll go more in-depth on
this later-on.</p>

<h3>The Lexical Analyzer</h3>

<p>The character stream is read into first component in the compilation pipeline:
the <strong>lexical analyzer</strong>, which maps the <em>character stream</em> into a <em>&ldquo;token&rdquo;
stream</em>. It seems like a <strong>token</strong> knows its <em>tag</em>, and its <em>value</em>. The
<strong>tag</strong> is basically the <em>type</em> of this token in the eyes of the compiler.
Possible tags in their example include <code>NUM</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>[keyword]</code>s, and I added
<code>COMMENT</code> as part of an exercise. The <strong>value</strong> for a token might be the
literal <em>value</em> of a literal; or it might be the name of a variable. More about
that below.</p>

<h4>Symbol Tables</h4>

<p>In addition to creating the token stream, the lexical analyzer builds the
<em>symbol table</em>. It seems to that the <strong>symbol table</strong> maps names to places in
memory. A symbol table also &lsquo;by default&rsquo; implements the language&rsquo;s preferred
form of <em>block scoping</em>. Upon entering a new scope, a new symbol table is
created that points to its &ldquo;parent&rdquo;, the one it is nested inside of. If a
variable is <em>declared</em>, it is added to the symbol table to this scope. Later,
when a variable is <em>referenced</em> (i.e. init&rsquo;d, read, or updated), we will
consult the table for the current innermost scope. If the variable&rsquo;s data is
not found there, we will continue to check ancestors until we find it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The goal of my first project at my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; job is to get something useful
done within a few days and start to feel like a contributing member of the
team. However it has been about a week, and I still have not finished that
project.</p>

<p>From my experience talking with some of my colleagues so far, their collective
attitude might be summed up with, &ldquo;Google it, then copy-paste it, but don&rsquo;t
worry about what it does.&rdquo; In my life, I have worked with and met <em>many</em> people
having that attitude. Partially because of my experience working with those
people, it happens to decidedly <em>not</em> be <em>my</em> attitude. My attitude is more
like &ldquo;google it, learn what to do, learn why that is the right approach, take
notes, and then copy-paste and modify the best solution to make the final
solution as clean as possible.&rdquo; This strategy got me through many tough
situations, so I have built up faith in it.</p>

<p>So, after seeing me spend <em>days</em> learning about ssh tunnelling, ansible, and
vagrant &mdash; and not finishing my simple project &mdash; they finally said something
along the lines of</p>

<blockquote><p>At this rate it will take you weeks to learn how to automate deployment of a
virtual machine. Why don&rsquo;t you just deploy <em>one</em> copy and then learn about
how to automate it on your <em>own</em> time?</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; is probably an overstatement, but they pointed out to me that I
had sort of assumed out of nowhere that I was hired as some sort of devops role
for the company, even though what I&rsquo;m actually interested in is what one might
call &ldquo;big data engineering&rdquo;. They said, &ldquo;<em>If</em> you find yourself repeating the
same tasks over and over, <em>then</em> you should learn to automate them.&rdquo; It is now
obvious that they are in the right.</p>

<p>At the time, I was startled by the way they approached me about what I consider
to be largely a difference in personalities. But I can see that they are
concerned that someone who reads too much never gets anything done, and so far
I have fit that stereotype. At the same time, I am concerned that a person who
<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> read will do their work quickly and incorrectly and will then spend
the next few weeks rejiggering a broken project, and so far they have fit that
stereotype. In short, it seems that we are all prejudiced and have plenty to
learn from each other.</p>

<p>Going forward I shall take their advice and do the more mundane tasks as fast
as possible and only learn things that come up more than once. If that doesn&rsquo;t
work out for me because I&rsquo;m just cranking out shitty work, I will revert back
to understanding what I am doing.</p>
