<div class="entry-content"><h2>The problem of HTTP/1.1</h2>

<h3>HTTP/1.1 is from an earlier Web</h3>

<p>For the past several years, Google, Mozilla, Akamai, the IETF, the academic
research community, and others have been engaged in efforts to reduce PLTs
experienced by users of the WWW. One bottleneck in apparent need of an update
is the now-&ldquo;ancient&rdquo; HTTP/1.1 (H1) protocol, published in 1999.</p>

<p>From the beginning, one of the major design goals of the original HTTP protocol
was simplicity to implement and adopt, to encourage growth of the WWW.
Evidently, this technique worked. However, over the past 16 years, the way
people create, distribute, and view pages on the WWW has changed drastically.
Pages today have far more Javascript, CSS, images, and other content to go
along with the vanilla HTML. In the course of this evolution, numerous issues
with H1 have come up, mostly pertaining to the number of sequential round-trips
it requires to fully download the data for each web page. These round-trips
introduce unnecessary latency.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Over the past 16 years, countermeasures, &ldquo;optional&rdquo; protocol alterations, and
application level workarounds have been suggested and implemented to reduce the
round-trip count and therefore latency of pages retrieved using H1.</p>

<h3>HTTP/1.1 PLT Optimizations</h3>

<p>Some optimizations servers and browsers use to lower PLTs seen by clients are
the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Opening multiple TCP connections to request the download of multiple
required web page resources in parallel.</li>
<li>Inlining and concatenating scripts and stylesheets to reduce the number of
requests.</li>
<li><em>HTTP pipelining</em>, in which multiple requests are sent by the browser over a
single TCP connection before waiting for responses to any, then the server
sends all of the responses back in the same order.</li>
</ol>


<p>HTTP pipelining was an idea that did not work out. It seemed like a logical
approach to improve HTTP performance by reducing latency. However, in reality,
HOL blocking became an even greater issue then it already had been, and it also
led to issues with older proxies that are difficult to update. Nowadays, modern
browsers do not enable pipelining.</p>

<h2>HTTP/2 aims to address these issues</h2>

<p>The main reason multiple resources can&rsquo;t be <em>multiplexed</em> (downloaded in
parallel) over a single TCP connection in H1 is because it is an ASCII
protocol. Being an ASCII protocol means that there is no easy way to specify
how to demultiplex those responses with a parser.</p>

<p>To address this, HTTP/2 (H2) is a <em>binary</em> protocol that <em>can</em> easily multiplex
multiple requests and responses through a single TCP connection. It does this
using a new <em>binary framing layer</em>, in which responses are broken into separate
<em>frames</em> and interleaved through the TCP socket.</p>

<p>Web designers have discovered that to yield the best user experience, the
server should transmit certain most-important resources first, as soon as they
are available to send (e.g. loaded from disk). H2 frames (and <em>streams</em>) have
an (optional) <code>priority</code> field to allow the application developer (and server
writer) to bias the ordering of frames sent through the socket. For example,
one may want to ensure that <code>.html</code> files have a higher priority than <code>.jpeg</code>
files because <code>.jpeg</code>s contain a lot of data and are not as crucial for showing
the user a <em>barebones</em> version of the page they requested.</p>

<h3>Brief History</h3>

<p>The current H2 specification (RFC 7540) is based primarily on the SPDY protocol
invented and first used at Google. Google is in a rather unique position to
conduct research on this topic because they write the code running large
proportion of both user&rsquo;s browsers, <em>as well as</em> the servers for a large
portion of the web pages those people visit. This allows them to run real
controlled experimental studies on web traffic, to try to guage the best way to
speed up the Web.</p>

<p>Many have voiced concerns that Google&rsquo;s ideas are welcomed to quickly by the
standards committee. However, supporters are eager to get the ball rolling on
any good ideas, and point to the fact that Google already has <em>results</em>.</p>

<p>Note that some of the experimental results below were actually obtained using
SPDY rather than H2, but we will not concern ourselves with that because they
are the same in essence. Google Chrome still supports SPDY, but has claimed it
will remove support in 2016 so that there are not two competing
standardizations of basically the same protocol.</p>

<p>In reality, in my Chrome browser, using the &ldquo;HTTP/2 and SPDY indicator&rdquo;
extension, I can see that Google&rsquo;s search results and YouTube videos are served
over SPDY/3 running on top of their still-in-research QUIC protocol which is
meant to replace TCP as the transport layer protocol underneath HTTP. The
&ldquo;indicator&rdquo; reveals that many websites are in fact already being served over
H2, including Twitter. I hope to explore what exactly QUIC does, promises, and
delivers further in my research if there is time and space for it.</p>

<h3>Experimental Results</h3>

<p>Experiments investigating relative performance differences between H1 and H2
have yielded contradictory results (Wang et al.). In (Wang et al.), they found
that H2 generally outperforms H1, except when the task is to transmit <em>large</em>
objects over a <em>high-loss</em> connection. One of the goals in defining H2 is that
it is supposed to be easy to swap-in in-place of H1. This finding indicates
that especially with respect to mobile phones, the H1 optimization techniques
of inlining and concatenating web page resources is the wrong way to
improve performance for H2.</p>

<h3>HTTP for Mobile</h3>

<p>With respect to mobile devices, there are multiple problems with HTTP that are
<em>not</em> addressed by H2 (Erman et al.).</p>

<p>First of all, TCP congestion window part of congestion avoidance (<code>cwnd</code> and
<code>ssthresh</code>) makes it so that dropping a single TCP datagram leads to a
drastically reduced throughput. This is because TCP assumes the packet was
dropped due to network congestion, when in reality, it could have been for any
of the wireless-specific issues (multipath propagation, etc.)</p>

<p>Secondly, bad interactions between the 3G &amp; LTE MAC state machine timeouts and
modern default TCP timeouts and mechanisms lead to datagram <em>retransmissions</em>
with further resets on congestion window state variables, resulting in a
drastically negative impact on throughput.</p>

<h3>Research is needed</h3>

<p>From the system administrators&#8217; perspective, it is still difficult to decide
whether enabling H2 on one&rsquo;s servers is going to have a positive impact on
performance <em>at all</em> (Varvello et al.). The following questions still do not
have good enough answers to make answering that decision easy.</p>

<ol>
<li>What changes to the infrastructure and optimization pipeline are needed to
provide a significant benefit over H1?</li>
<li>What are the best algorithms for leveraging H2&rsquo;s new capabilities for
<em>server push</em> and <em>prioritization</em>?</li>
<li>Why do experiments by different research groups yield such a wide disparity
in results?</li>
<li>Are we unlikely to see any real PLT improvements until we improve the
underlying transport layer protocol?</li>
<li>In what ways is the problem different for mobile?

<ul>
<li>What changes need to be made in the mobile-specific scenario, viz. where
interference, low bandwidth, high latency, and battery life
considerations are major concerns?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
