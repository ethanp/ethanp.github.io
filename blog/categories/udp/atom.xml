    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of what I&rsquo;ve learned and discussed here comes from <em>TCP/IP Sockets in
Java</em>, a highly recommended book about this stuff by Calvert and Donahoo. Some
of it also comes from <em>Java Network Programming</em> by Elliotte Rusty Harold.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <em>only</em> transport-layer protocols Java supports are TCP &amp; UDP; for
anything else, you must link to native code via the Java Native Interface</li>
<li>TCP uses <em>stream</em> sockets, through which one generally just writes to an
<code>OutputStream</code> and reads from an <code>InputStream</code> of bytes that remain in-order
and uncorrupted and are (practically) guaranteed delivery by the
implementation of the protocol by the operating system.

<ul>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;re using NIO; see below for more on that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UDP uses <em>datagram</em> sockets, through which you <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> objects
called <code>DatagramPacket</code>s, which are just a length, a destination, and data</li>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;re using NIO, everything <em>blocks</em>: e.g. connecting to servers,
listening for clients, reads, writes, and disconnecting (for TCP)

<ul>
<li>By default most of these actions may block <em>indefinitely</em></li>
<li>For reading and connecting, you can configure a timeout, after which you
will receive an <code>InterruptedIOException</code></li>
<li>For <em>writing</em> to a TCP stream, you <em>cannot</em> configure a timeout</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Handling multiple clients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Deal with one at a time, which is simplest, especially if there&rsquo;s some state
that is shared by all potential clients. Speed may become problematic
quickly.</li>
</ul>


<p>```java
void mainLoop() {</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
    Socket s = serverSocket.accept();
    handle(s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
void handle(Socket s) {</p>

<pre><code>InputStream in = s.getInputStream();
// process request, etc.
s.close();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
* Create a new thread to handle each incoming client. This is still pretty
  simple, but will lead to massive overhead if you have many concurrent
  clients, and therefore you&rsquo;re context-switching all the time.</p>

<p>```java
void mainLoop() {</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
    Socket s = serverSocket.accept();
    new Thread() {
        @Override public void run() {
            InputStream in = s.getInputStream();
            // process request, etc.
            s.close();
        }
    }.start()
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a thread pool to handle requests. Java has abstracted the thread pool
concept into the <code>Executors</code> factory class. There are a multitude of
executors to choose from. This <code>newCachedThreadPool()</code> one will execute each
task on an existing thread if one is idle, and will create a thread
otherwise. Threads sitting idle in the cache for over one minute are
terminated.</li>
</ul>


<p>```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</p>

<p>void mainLoop() {</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
    Socket s = serverSocket.accept();
    executor.execute(new TheHandler(s));
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
static class TheHandler implements Runnable {</p>

<pre><code>Socket s;
public TheHandler(Socket s) { this.s = s; }
@Override public void run() {
    InputStream in = s.getInputStream();
    // process request, etc.
    s.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<ul>
<li>Use NIO (rather complicated) to allow <code>N</code> threads to service <code>M</code>
clients, where <code>N</code> is small and <code>M</code> is huge. This uses event-based
programming. We can set all network operations to be non-blocking, and
only wait as long as we want to for them. An extensive example can be
found below.</li>
<li>Use a framework like Netty, Akka, etc. that wraps the NIO stuff up in a
ribbon and a tie</li>
</ul>


<h3>10K feet above NIO</h3>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using NIO, you create <code>Channel</code>s of bytes into and out of sockets
(or file handles)</li>
<li>You register a <code>Selector</code> to be notified when the <code>Channel</code> is ready to be
read from or written to</li>
<li>You query the <code>Selector</code> to tell you which <code>Channel</code> are ready, and may then
take action on those that are</li>
<li>You get data in and out by passing a <code>Buffer</code> to the <code>Channel</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an example based on TCP/IP Sockets in Java, a highly recommended book
about this stuff by Calvert and Donahoo.</p>

<p>```java
Selector slctr = Selector.open(); // factory
ServerSocketChannel chnl = ServerSocketChannel.open(); // factory
chnl.socket().bind(inetAddr); // set address to listen on</p>

<p>// For some reason Channels block by default. If we want to
// register with the Selector for notifications, we must turn
// that off.
chnl.configureBlocking(false);</p>

<p>// Notify Selector whenever this Channel has a new connection
// ready to be &ldquo;accepted&rdquo;. Such a notification still does
// <em>not</em> guarantee it will work immediately.
chnl.register(slctr, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);</p>

<p>while (true) {</p>

<pre><code>// wait configurable period of time to be notified
// by any registered channel
int numNotifications = slctr.select(timeoutMS);
if (numNotifications == 0) {
    // We timed out without any notification.
    // We could do whatever we want here because we're
    // no longer blocked.
} else {
    // numNotifications different channels have notified us of
    // being available for Connect, Read, Accept, or Write.
    // It is OK to use these keys in concurrent threads.
    for (SelectionKey key : slctr.selectedKeys()) {
        // We're not sure which channel this key belonged to.
        // Also, notification was just a "hint" and we need to
        // check again whether the Channel is available.
        if (key.isAcceptable()) {
            // here's the actual call to accept()
            SocketChannel clientChnl =
                ((ServerSocketChannel) key.channel()).accept();

            // similar to the ServerSocketChannel
            clientChnl.configureBlocking(false);
            // Except that here we register to notify Selector
            // about being "readable", and
            clientChnl.register(
                key.selector(),
                SelectionKey.OP_READ,
                // We must associate an "attachment" with this
                // channel. This is the buffer that will be
                // filled with the incoming bytes rcvd via TCP.
                ByteBuffer.allocate(NUM_BYTES) // eg 256?
            );
        }
        if (key.isReadable()) {
            // retrieve the readable client socket's channel
            SocketChannel client =
                (SocketChannel) key.channel();

            // retrieve the ByteBuffer we associated with
            // that channel
            ByteBuffer buf = (ByteBuffer) key.attachment();

            // Attempt to read `buf.remaining()` bytes _from_
            // the Channel _into_ the ByteBuffer.
            int bytesRead = client.read(buf);

            // -1 from read() means end-of-stream, which in
            // this case means the client closed their output
            // side of the TCP connection. We may still be
            // able to send data if that side of the connection
            // has not been closed yet.
            if (bytesRead == -1) client.close();

            else if (bytesRead &gt; 0) {
                // if our application has data to write back
                // to the client, we must tell the selector
                // that we've now become interested in writing
                key.interestOps(SelectionKey.OP_READ
                                | SelectionKey.OP_WRITE);
            }
        }
        // socket not closed, and is writable
        if (key.isValid() &amp;&amp; key.isWritable()) {
            // beyond the scope of this post.
        }
    }
}

<h2>Tips for Traps</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t write to the network through a <code>PrintStream</code>

<ul>
<li>It chooses end-of-line chars based on your platform, not the protocol
(HTTP uses <code>\r\n</code>)</li>
<li>It uses the default char encoding of your platform (likely UTF-8), not
whatever the server expects (likely UTF-8)</li>
<li>It eats all exceptions into this <code>boolean checkError()</code> method, when
you&rsquo;re better off just using the normal exception hubbub</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
