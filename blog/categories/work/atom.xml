    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just had my first experience of &ldquo;deploying my system into production&rdquo;. I
have been learning about software engineering for a few years now, and I have
seen this term &ldquo;deploy into production&rdquo; many times, but never experienced it
myself. The &ldquo;software system&rdquo; that was deployed is an internal tool, almost 3
months in development by yours truly. This article is a retrospective of the
development of this system so far.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The system itself uses many APIs with which I was previously unfamiliar;
Kafka, Elasticsearch, HDFS, ZooKeeper, Spray, CouchDB, etc.; but I have glued
together unfamiliar APIs on many previous occasions. The system is
&ldquo;distributed&rdquo; and has in-built fault-tolerance in various ways; but I have
included that feature in previous projects. The thing that is new for me about
this project is that it was written with maintainability as a goal, and
&ldquo;released&rdquo; in such a way that it runs continuously as a service, and its
output can serve as input for the daily work of other human beings. This is my
first project for my first job, and it is finally working.</p>

<p>There were <em>many</em> times during the development of this project when I figured
it would probably be deployed within the next few days. At those points, I
told my manager to begin finding me something interesting to work on next. He
always sounded more skeptical than I expected about the project actually being
nearly done. On each of those occasions, I realized within the next few hours
after announcing my near-completion, that there was still, in fact, a <em>slew</em>
of components still needing to be worked out before the software could be
deployed, and that I had <em>no idea</em> how to craft any of these components.</p>

<p>There are <em>too many</em> guides out there about how to develop and deploy software
systems. For me, the most important ended up being <a href="https://medium.com/@jlouis666/how-to-build-stable-systems-6fe9dcf32fc4">a Medium article</a> by
Jesper L. Andersen (no idea who that is). I think I found the article on Hacker
News a month and a half ago. I will summarize my takaways from it</p>

<ul>
<li>The developer is responsible for every aspect of the software</li>
<li>Make sure the project makes sense to tackle</li>
<li>Choose the right libraries, frameworks etc. to use

<ul>
<li>This requires a small amount of experimentation which should be done up
front in a separated/extracted code-base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit scope

<ul>
<li>E.g. create a list of problems you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> solving</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit external dependencies</li>
<li>Create a transition plan from the previous system to the new one</li>
<li>Design for future extension</li>
<li>Prefer correctness and elegance to efficiency of execution

<ul>
<li>This is especially true for my project because it is network bound anyway</li>
<li>But still, understand which parts must be more correct than others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collect metrics about system performance</li>
<li>Write automated tests of whether

<ul>
<li>The components that need to do something correctly are</li>
<li>The different components of the system can communicate with each other
effectively</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There are still aspects of my system that are not perfect. For example, I
occasionaly see errors about a timeout in some library used by a library I am
using. I don&rsquo;t know whether those errors are corrupting my data, or killing
JVM threads, or whatever else. The system is already a vast improvement over
what was in place before in terms of correctness and latency of the data
produced, so having the occasional issue was not a good enough reason to delay
deployment any further.</p>

<p>The system was deployed in a manner one might describe as &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;. I rsync
the code onto a server, build the code on the server, open up two <code>tmux</code>
windows, run one JVM which produces to Kafka, run another JVM which consumes
from Kafka, make sure everything that is <em>supposed</em> to be happening <em>is</em>
happening, and detach from tmux. According to the blog post I linked above, it
is desirable to be able to hit a button and see it deploy itself
automatically. In my case this conflicts with the other suggestion in that
article, which is to stick to limit the number of things you have to learn in
order to get the first version of your software working, which I believe the
author meant to be more important than a one-click deployment scheme.</p>

<p>The system is not exactly &ldquo;done&rdquo; in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t have all the
features it is supposed to have. But at least I know now that the system works
in its production environment and is able to interact successfully and
(demonstrably) correctly with all the external infrastructure that it relies
upon. But to be sure, many corners were cut, many pieces are <em>kind of</em> there
but not really, the metrics are not collected well, and configurations (e.g.
of Kafka, ZooKeeper, and Elasticsearch) were chosen on a &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll probably get
us running&rdquo; basis. As it turns out, there have already been issues with
Elasticsearch not being able to handle the load of multiple of my colleagues
querying it at once.</p>

<p>A problem with having deployed it without a larger share of the issues worked-
out is that I now need to be more careful to make my changes behave as
transitions from &ldquo;working state&rdquo; to &ldquo;working state&rdquo;. There are pieces of the
system that if they are left not-working for more than 24 hours, data will be
irretrievably lost, and people will be sad. But by design of the software, the
piece that <em>must</em> be left running properly is mostly disentangled from the
rest of the system, so that it can run while the rest of the system is
offline, and none of the data will be lost. This is accomplished by buffering
data in Kafka.</p>

<p>Since I have no previous experience deploying a software system like this, I
did not have a good basis to evaluate which libraries to build my system upon,
except for the buzz that I see on Hacker News, and my own intuition and
background. I like the Scala programming language best, and because of Spark,
some people I work with already use Scala, so I chose Scala. Is Go a better
tool for the job? According to the relative buzzes of the two ecosystems on
Hacker News, maybe it is. Would Docker have provided a better mechanism for
deployment? Most-likely it would have, but that can be added at any time if it
turns out that deployment is a <em>problem</em> which needs to be <em>solved</em>, which at
this simple stage, it is not.</p>

<p>It is exciting to final have real people relying on code that I wrote. I am
excited to continue making this system better-meet the needs of its users. I
am even more excited by the shift in the way I look at writing software now
that I have seen more of the lifecycle of a single project.</p>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/02/27/asking-for-advice/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-27T15:38:06-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/02/27/asking-for-advice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many circumstances in life during which one may feel the need to ask
for advice. For example, when evaluating a significant decision, or when
dealing with an emotionally stressful circumstance. Here, I will discuss
advice about significant decisions.</p>

<p>In giving advice, everyone has a different approach. I generally try to follow
a line I heard in a rap song by The Streets, &ldquo;If you never tell a lie to her,
you don&rsquo;t have to remember anything.&rdquo; In other words, lying will only
complicate your life because you have to remember the lies you made up.
(Caveat: this may not always the best way to go for emotionally complex
issues.) I also enjoy helping people rationally and realistically evaluate
their options for significant decisions, and surely if someone recalls that
your input was helpful in the past, they will be more likely to ask you in the
future.</p>

<p>Most people I know don&rsquo;t seem to like giving useful advice. It seems they
either are (1) too afraid that their honesty will lead you to dislike them, or
(2) they feel so stressed with their own issues that taking on yours for a few
minutes would be overwhelming, or (3) they find your problem uninteresting and
simply have better things to do.</p>

<p>But some people are the opposite. They will patiently listen to your question
and give what they feel to be an honest evaluation of where you stand and what
you should do. The advice of people in this category will often be heavily and
obviously biased by their own experience and ideology. This is simply a
symptom of &ldquo;being honest&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So if you want good advice, it would be ideal to find someone who is honest,
not stressed about a similar problem to yours, as well as interested in and
knowledgeable of the subject; they should generally also be disinterested in
your particular problem. However, this ideal candidate is not always
available.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In that case one can obviously try the timeless &ldquo;pros vs cons&rdquo; list, which
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily rely on external sources of wisdom, but often external
sources of wisdom are critical. One can ask unideal candidates for advice, and
maybe they&rsquo;ll at least have some curt nugget that has some use. That&rsquo;s what I
usually do, and it is generally not effective at all, but occasionaly that
curt nugget is exactly the required pithy jewel.</p>

<p>One can consult the Internet, but I kind of assumed that if you needed advice,
you already checked the Internet for answers. But to go one step further you
can <em>ask</em> the Internet, treating it like this all knowing Oracle. This will
work to varying degrees depending on your problem. If your problem is one that
everyone and their mother has an opinion on, you will end up sifting through
junk answers, and may or may not get anything useful. In that case, the more
details you can reveal, the more benefit you will obtain. Of course <em>where</em>
you ask matters: for example Quora will be more effective than Yahoo Answers.
If your problem is esoteric, <em>find the people who are into that thing</em>.</p>

<p>For example, I have noticed to my surprise that StackOverflow/StackExchange is
not always the best place for all programming-related questions, because if
your question is esoteric to one technological ecosystem, the question-
answering population on StackOverflow won&rsquo;t necessarily have the flag-bearers
of the cause of that particular ecosystem. But if it really is an ecosystem,
it will have a place where the flag-bearers dwell, so <em>find it</em> and they will
probably help. In my experience, IRC channels tend to be empty; Gitter
channels may be well-attended; Github issues get a lot of flak for being a
mess, but are often effective if you&rsquo;re sure your question isn&rsquo;t stupid;
mailing lists can be high-latency but that&rsquo;s often where the true experts of
super-technical projects converse. Following <strong>good forum-question-asking
practices</strong> is <em>crucial</em> in <em>any</em> of these environments, and it can be
trickier to do that than it sounds. <strong>The better you phrase your question, the
more appealing it is to answer in the eyes of a high-quality potential source
of advice.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes the advice you receive from multiple sources will be in direct
conflict with each other. I have been having this issue a lot lately. Let&rsquo;s
say one person suggested I do <code>A</code>, and another suggested I do <code>not A</code>. I have
decided this pair of suggestions implies that <em>either</em> decision is just fine,
which is basically the ideal outcome; viz. my so-called &ldquo;significant decision&rdquo;
was not so significant after all and doesn&rsquo;t not need to be balanced
carefully.</p>

<p>Just some biased thoughts from my experience; take some, leave some, etc.</p>
