    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to align a data structure at the nearest word-alignment to a given
starting address, we&rsquo;d must find the smallest multiple of N (a power of 2)
which is greater than or equal to integer X. Is there a way we can <em>make this
fast</em>, i.e. not use division or modulo?</p>

<h2>First Thoughts</h2>

<h3>First of all</h3>

<p><code>c
if (N &gt; X) return N;
</code></p>

<h3>Otherwise, we have two cases</h3>

<h4>First Case</h4>

<pre><code>N: 00100
X: 01100
--------
=&gt; 01100
</code></pre>

<p>This example indicates the following:</p>

<p><code>c
if (!(X &amp; (N-1))) return X;
</code></p>

<h4>Second Case</h4>

<pre><code>N: 00100       
X: 01101       
--------       
=&gt; 10000       
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be accomplished by</p>

<p><code>c
return (X | (N-1)) + 1;
</code></p>

<p>So we have the first-take program of</p>

<p><code>c
if (N &gt; X) return N;
if (!(X &amp; (N-1))) return X;
return (X | (N-1)) + 1;
</code></p>

<h2>Engineering Wisdom</h2>

<p>The above solution is in fact correct <em>(takes a quick bow)</em>.</p>

<p>When I looked up a better answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19450743">StackOverflow</a>, I found a
program that does not use conditionals, and is therefore much faster</p>

<p><code>c
return (X + N - 1) &amp; ~(N - 1);
</code></p>

<p>However, it was not obvious to me that this program works! Let&rsquo;s peer inside
and see how similar it is to my solution.</p>

<p>First we&rsquo;re going to compute something, and then we&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;and&rdquo; it with
<code>~(N-1)</code>. Well, &ldquo;and"ing <em>anything</em> against <code>~(N-1)</code> is going to round it down
to a multiple of N. So that part is taken care of.</p>

<p>Now we need to get the <em>right</em> multiple of N. <code>if X &lt; N</code>, then then adding X to
N and rounding down to a multiple N is just going to give us N. That&rsquo;s the
first line of my answer, taken care of.</p>

<p>So <code>if X &gt; N</code>, we either do or don&rsquo;t have bits in place values below N. This is
what my last two lines are taking care of. However, we can deal with this by
noting that after we add X to N, if there are bits in place values below N,
when we subtract 1, it will not change any bits that will survive the &ldquo;and&rdquo;
stage. But if there are no bits in place values below N, then subtracting one
will decrement our answer wrt bits N and higher.</p>

<p>Hmm, not the best explanation of all time. But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on in there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>My &ldquo;Learning&rdquo; Workflow</h3>

<p>As I wrote about <a href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/how-apm-originally-worked/">before</a>, I have developed an interesting method of learning
from experts, which can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork their repo on GitHub</li>
<li>Clone the repo locally and &ldquo;detach the <code>HEAD</code>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;inital commmit&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now repeat the following <code>while (curious)</code>

<ol>
<li>Open the working tree in an editor/IDE</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s something runnable, run it</li>
<li>Understand everything going on in the working tree

<ul>
<li>Take hints from the commit message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advance <code>HEAD</code> one commit</li>
<li>View the diff from the previous commit</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>SourceTree cannot handle this workload</h3>

<p>I have always used Atlassian&rsquo;s Git GUI called SourceTree for all of my Git
usage because it is a <em>great</em> application, but the fact is, it will not work
for the workflow above. SourceTree has to rebuild the list of commits <em>all the
time</em> (startingfrom the most recent), and when there are thousands of commits,
that can take about a minute. But since I&rsquo;m always operating at the beginning
of the reverse end of the commit log, using SourceTree is untenable. For
whatever reason they decided it was a better idea not to keep all these commits
in memory after they are loaded the first time. I&rsquo;m not saying that was a bad
decision, because my workflow here may be <em>atypical</em>.</p>

<h3>Git is a DAG pointing back in time</h3>

<p>From what I understand&mdash;which is not (yet) a whole lot&mdash;Git is a DAG of
&ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of the state of your project. Each snapshot points to its parents.</p>

<p>In a typical case, you&rsquo;ll load a snapshot, edit your working directory, add the
changes into the staging area, and <strong>commit</strong> a new snapshot which equals the
previous snapshot, plus the staged changes. Now your new commit has <em>one</em>
parent: the previous snapshot.</p>

<p>A <strong>merge commit</strong> would have <strong>two parents</strong>: the previous commit on the
branch being committed to, and the previous commit on the branch being merged-
in.</p>

<h3>The Learning workflow flows the wrong way</h3>

<p>The Learning worflow would require pointers to the <em>next</em> commit, not just
back-pointers. So it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit the Git mold, and we require a
workaround.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where StackOverflow saves the day. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2121230/git-how-to-move-back-and-forth-between-commits/23172256#23172256">Here</a> someone modified
a StackOverflow answer by someone else to a <em>related</em> question, and produced
wrappers that help you traverse back and forth between commits. I reproduce an
explicated and slightly simplified version below which may be added to your
shell config file.</p>

<p>```scala</p>

<h1>checkout prev (older) revision</h1>

<p>git_prev() {</p>

<pre><code># move HEAD "one" generation back along *this* branch
git checkout HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<h1>checkout next (newer) commit</h1>

<p>git_next() {</p>

<pre><code># git show ref:
#       show (commit-sha, ref-name) pairs for current-versions of all 
#       "refs"; i.e. tags, remote branches, and local branches
# 
# git show-ref -s HEAD:
#       get sha of latest commit on branch pointed to by HEAD
#
# BRANCH=...:
#       get the name of the branch HEAD is on
#
# HASH=`git rev-prase $BRANCH`
#       get the hash of the latest commit on the current branch
#
# git rev-list --topo-order HEAD..$HASH:
#       list all commit sha's in order on the current branch from
#       HEAD until now 
#
# PREV=...:
#       get the commit sha for the commit after HEAD on branch
#
# git checkout $PREV
#       move head to the next commit
#
BRANCH=`git show-ref | grep $(git show-ref -s HEAD) | sed 's|.*/||' | grep -v HEAD | sort -u`
HASH=`git rev-parse $BRANCH`
PREV=`git rev-list --topo-order HEAD..$HASH | tail -1`
git checkout $PREV
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>With that knowledge in tow, I also made a little command to jump to the <em>i</em>&lsquo;th
commit on master. If you&rsquo;re trying to jump to the <em>i</em>'th commit on the current
branch, get the current branch using the <code>BRANCH=...</code> code above, and pass it
to <code>rev-list</code>.</p>

<p>```scala
gitj() {</p>

<pre><code>git checkout `git rev-list master | tail -n$1 | head -n1`
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>$ gitj 1    # jump to initial commit of master
$ gitj 3    # jump to third commit
```</p>

<h3>Wrappin it up</h3>

<p>So yeah, now the workflow is simpler to use and it was made possible by gaining
a better understanding of how Git works.</p>
