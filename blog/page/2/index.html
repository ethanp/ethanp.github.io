  <div class="entry-content"><h3>How I Found it</h3>

<p>I was watching a biography of Richard Feynman, and they interviewed this guy W.
Daniel Hillis, and he seemed like a cool dude so I looked him up on Google, and
came across his book, <strong><em>The Pattern in the Stone: The Simple Ideas that Make
Computers Work</em></strong> (1999). On Amazon it was compared to <strong><em>Code: The Hidden
Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em></strong>, by Charles Petzold, an
encredibly well- written book about how computers work. I would gladly read any
book considered comparable in lucidity to <em>Code</em>, so I got <em>The Pattern in the
Stone</em>.</p>

<h3>What it says</h3>

<p>The first few chapters are meant to give a basic understanding of what a
computer is actually doing, and he spends some time noting the Universality of
computers, which he says shows that &ldquo;all computers are alike in what they can
and cannot do&rdquo;. Personally, my intuition of the workings of a computer comes
mainly from an explanation by Richard Feynman himself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA">as seen on the
YouTubes</a>) which is &ldquo;heuristic&rdquo; rather than mechanical. Basically
Feynman gradually turns a human being into a computer, and then talks about how
this mechanistic person can be implemented using logic gates built from water
pipes that he sketches on a whiteboard. In <em>Pattern in the Stone&#8221;</em>, he builds
logic gates out of parallel and series wires, and also out of springs and
pivots.</p>

<p>Then he introduces finite state machines and programming in LOGO. Then he
mentions how machine code can be thought of as <em>control instructions</em>,
specifying the next instruction to fetch and execute, and <em>processing
instructions</em>, moving data to and from memory, and through the Arithmetic Logic
Unit.</p>

<p>Then he starts really getting into what I think is the main point of the book,
to convince the reader that there is no magical process occurring in our brains
that a mechanical computer cannot replicate, meaning that</p>

<blockquote><p>As far as we know, no device built in the physical universe can have any more
computational power than a Turing machine&hellip;[so] a universal computer with
the proper programming should be able to simulate the function of a human
brain.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>My &ldquo;Learning&rdquo; Workflow</h3>

<p>As I wrote about <a href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/how-apm-originally-worked/">before</a>, I have developed an interesting method of learning
from experts, which can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork their repo on GitHub</li>
<li>Clone the repo locally and &ldquo;detach the <code>HEAD</code>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;inital commmit&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now repeat the following <code>while (curious)</code>

<ol>
<li>Open the working tree in an editor/IDE</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s something runnable, run it</li>
<li>Understand everything going on in the working tree

<ul>
<li>Take hints from the commit message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advance <code>HEAD</code> one commit</li>
<li>View the diff from the previous commit</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few days I have been learning how <code>apm</code>, the Atom Package Manager
works under the hood. <code>apm</code> is what you use when, in GitHub&rsquo;s (relatively new)
&ldquo;Atom&rdquo; text editor, you go to the nice gui package installation interface under
<code>settings=&gt;packages</code>.</p>

<p>Atom is a &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; text editor built on top of Chromium, using Node.js and
Coffeescript. I believe they call it hackable because all the code is open
source, and you can add plugins to do whatever you want. Your plugins can even
be written in C++ if that&rsquo;s more your style.</p>

<p>My goal was to figure out how <code>apm</code> works, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure how best to do
that. My knowledge of Node.js was minimal, and I was no expert in Coffeescript.
What I decided to do was fork the <code>apm</code> GitHub repo, clone it onto my computer,
and set my local HEAD to the <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/b8f4ce0d0cda458853eb280fde39fdeb2de38ebd">&ldquo;initial commit&rdquo;</a>, and see if I could
understand that. The complete contents are as follows</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>README.md</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'># APM - Atom Package Manager
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Discover and install Atom packages.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this stage I pretty confident that I understood everthing the author Kevin
Sawicki was doing. Lucky for me, it seems Kevin is rather unique on GitHub&rsquo;s
Atom development team for having smaller commits. I can justify this by noting
that on Atom-core&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/graphs/contributors">list of developer contributions</a>, he has 2x more
commits than the next guy, but is not in the top 5 in terms of LOC added.</p>

<p>So with my head fully wrapped around the &ldquo;initial commit&rdquo; I moved my HEAD past
the 2nd commit (a typo fix) into the first commit of any substance, <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/31294702b11061e60214357f4529fb9b00a7068d">&ldquo;Add
initial Gruntfile, binary, and ignores&rdquo;</a>. At this point there was some
investigation to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Getting to the same page</h3>

<p>When a colleague and I are in a discussion about something and both start to
get very excited about where it is going, I start to believe that we both must
be seeing things in the same way. This is a fantasy. You start to feel that
&ldquo;connection&rdquo;; it gets palpable. It feels like we&rsquo;re really communicating
consciousness to consciousness. It feels like thoughts are pipelining across
thin air. Sometimes it&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;d posit that usually it is not. And this
misunderstanding of the true level of agreement can later be a cause of grief.
You feel like the other person abandoned your shared vision when they take the
result of your conversation and make something different from what you
intended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After some further thought, it has become clear that my previous post about
abstractions and what makes them good got it all wrong. There, I said roughly
that an abstraction is something that allows you to simplify a hard mental task
to make that task easier. This needs to be reevaluated. The earlier post
claimed that a hammer is an improper abstraction for opening up a package. That
just doesn&rsquo;t sound right. A hammer is nothing more than a bad <em>tool</em> for
opening up a package. A <em>tool</em> is something that makes a task easier. A tool
and an abstraction are not equivalent.</p>

<p>My Software Architecture professor began the semester by giving us about 20
very similar definitions of what software architecture is, to give us a general
sense of what people are talking about. I left the lecture equally uninformed
about what software architecture is, but did eventually come to grips with it.
With the Sisyphean nature of the task now understood, I would like to propose a
new definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>An abstraction is a way of conceptualizing something without having to think
about everything that is actually going on. If we think in terms of the
abstraction, we can arrive at the same conclusions as could have been derived
using the &ldquo;underlying truth of the matter&rdquo; without as much mental effort.
After communicating the chain of logic using the abstraction, the listener
would also be able to derive the result by substituting the abstraction out
for the &ldquo;underlying truth&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is basically a mental shorthand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Creating good abstractions may have more value than anything else. The more I
learn about creating a company and writing code, the more important I realize
proper abstractions are.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should start by listing a few abstractions that I find to be &ldquo;good&rdquo;
ones so that we&rsquo;re more on the same page, because this an abstract topic, and
everyone probably has a different conception of it. Surely I&rsquo;ve missed some of
the best ones, but these roll off my head:</p>

<ol>
<li>Programming languages (in that they are a higher-level representation of
machine-code)</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming</li>
<li>Design patterns &amp; architectural patterns</li>
<li>The mouse (input device)</li>
<li>A &ldquo;process&rdquo; as used in Unix</li>
<li>Most mathematical notation</li>
</ol>


<p>So what do these have in common? They give us a mental representation of what
we&rsquo;re doing that vastly simplifies what is actually going on. This means that
in order to come up with something which is at its base level very complex, we
only need to manipulate simplified mental objects. These means we must perform
fewer total mental operations, using less mental short-term memory, to achieve
the same result.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps the greatest lesson of this summer has been in taking advantage of the
power of collaboration.</p>

<p>When my boss decided to hire me, he told me that it was in large part because
of my communication skills. I don&rsquo;t know if he still agrees with this, but I
like to think it is true.</p>

<p>One of my greatest prides is the ability to openly lose an argument. For a long
time, this has quite often been my reason for entering an argument, and I try
to make it easy to lose. If someone seems to know they&rsquo;re right, we must
together find the bridge of what I&rsquo;m missing that will be convincing beyond a
reasonable doubt of their correctness. Making it easy to lose means figuring
out what you <em>actually</em> think, making that clear, and not wavering from that
initial point of view even when more facts come to light. Or at least
acknowledging that the original viewpoint was incorrect, and now <em>this</em> is what
I [honestly] believe to be true. A regrettable human tendancy is to change
one&rsquo;s opinion during an argument as the facts come to light because &ldquo;with these
facts, my original point of view was wrong, and clearly I wasn&rsquo;t wrong, so that
couldn&rsquo;t have been my real point of view.&rdquo; This needs to be consciously
avoided.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>BufferedReader</code> is suprisingly fast for parsing large text files. Why is that?
In my experience, it is faster for this task than a <code>BufferedInputStream</code>.
StackOverflow says this is because the <code>BufferedReader</code> uses <code>char</code> internally
instead of <code>byte</code>.</p>

<p>What follows is a high-level breakdown of what&rsquo;s going on &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; of
the <code>BufferedReader</code>, i.e. an overview of the implementation details.
Details about <code>mark</code> support will be omitted.</p>

<p>For me, the most significant takeaways are the following</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>There is no magic</strong> &mdash; every time I find this out about something I am
surpised. This class is probably <em>very</em> similar to the way I would have
naively written a buffering wrapper for a <code>Reader</code> object.</li>
<li><strong>Utmost efficiency is sacrificed for code clarity</strong> &mdash; my guess is that the
reason they left in the inefficiencies I mentioned above is because having
special cases would have clouded the code. If someone wants an even <em>more</em>
efficient <code>Reader</code> they are always welcome to write their own.</li>
<li><strong>Small amount of code</strong> &mdash; there&rsquo;s really not a whole lot to this class. It
basically just reads into a buffer, then services incoming reads from that
buffer. There are no &ldquo;niceties&rdquo; or asynchronous callbacks etc. I think the
attitude of the auther is that if you want to find that, simply look
elsewhere.

<ul>
<li>Of particular note: there is no a single mention of <em>character encodings</em>
anywhere in the class.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The scenario</h2>

<p>My (augmented todo-list) website has Categories, and <strong>each Category has a set
of Tasks</strong> (aka <em>&ldquo;one-to-many&rdquo;</em>).</p>

<blockquote><p>Using a relational database, one does not simply store references to all the
Tasks directly in each Category. With Mongo, one may do exactly that.</p></blockquote>

<p>After looking at various <strong>&ldquo;embedded vs references&rdquo;</strong>
<a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/">documents</a>, I have decided to go with the hybrid
model (the second of the three on that linked page), and <strong>embed references to
Tasks in an array in each Category</strong>.</p>

<h3>The console shall reveal the way to accomplish this</h3>

<p>My lack of sustained googling didn&rsquo;t turn up any online resources about how to
do it, so here you go.</p>

<h4>Install MongoDB</h4>

<p>After installing MongoDB with Homebrew, it became clear that the configuration
was still incomplete (perhaps because brew lacks root access to the root
directory). StackOverflow told me how to finish. I show you.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>mongo  <span class="c"># in another window (interactive console)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Write the code</h4>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s do an example of having a one-to-many relationship between Categories
and Tasks, where in particular, we are storing an array of Task id&rsquo;s in each
Category. In the end we will write a query to get all Tasks belonging to a
Category.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I met someone at a hack night worked for Akamai. He was a cool dude, so I was
curious what Akamai does. For whatever reason I ended up reading a paper cited
as so:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nygren, Erik, Ramesh K. Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. “The akamai network: a
platform for high-performance internet applications.” ACM SIGOPS Operating
Systems Review 44.3 (2010): 2–19.</p></blockquote>

<p>For whatever reason, everything I know about Akamai is from this paper. I&rsquo;m not
in any way afiliated with Akamai, etc., though the paper is basically a badly
designed advertising pamphlet for their services. A small number of sentences
in this summary may have been lifted directly from that paper. You can consider
this whole post a paraphrasing of the paper. <strong>The intent of this post is to
tell you everything important that I learned from the paper</strong> in a form that is
<em>way</em> easier to digest than you reading the paper itself. To that end, this
document is maybe 2 pages long, and the original is 17. Clearly much of the
detail has been removed, but the gist remains. If that appeals to you, welcome
aboard! Note that the paper is from 2010, so is probably already out of date.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Akamai invented the <em>Content Delivery Network</em> (CDN) concept in the 1990s,
because the raw naive Internet implementation is too slow to conduct a global
business. As of 2010, Akamai delivers 15-20% of global Web traffic.</p>

<h3>The Interwebs is a dangerous place</h3>
