  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The problem of HTTP/1.1</h2>

<h3>HTTP/1.1 is from an earlier Web</h3>

<p>For the past several years, Google, Mozilla, Akamai, the IETF, the academic
research community, and others have been engaged in efforts to reduce PLTs
experienced by users of the WWW. One bottleneck in apparent need of an update
is the now-&ldquo;ancient&rdquo; HTTP/1.1 (H1) protocol, published in 1999.</p>

<p>From the beginning, one of the major design goals of the original HTTP protocol
was simplicity to implement and adopt, to encourage growth of the WWW.
Evidently, this technique worked. However, over the past 16 years, the way
people create, distribute, and view pages on the WWW has changed drastically.
Pages today have far more Javascript, CSS, images, and other content to go
along with the vanilla HTML. In the course of this evolution, numerous issues
with H1 have come up, mostly pertaining to the number of sequential round-trips
it requires to fully download the data for each web page. These round-trips
introduce unnecessary latency.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why is WiFi so slow on the porch?</h2>

<p>The problem at my house is that WiFi connectivity is generally fine inside the
house, but while sitting on the porch it is nearly impossible for anyone to
browse the Hinternets. I think a lesson of my <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/classes/F15-CS386W/">Wireless Networking</a> course
explains this observation.</p>

<p>In Wireless networking we have the situation called the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hidden_node_problem"><strong>Hidden Terminal
Problem</strong></a>, which is the following. Node <code>A</code> is too far from node <code>C</code> to
hear its transmissions, but both are in range of node <code>B</code> which sits between
<code>A</code> and <code>C</code>. Suppose <code>C</code> is currently transmitting data to <code>B</code>. Now <code>A</code> checks
whether any transmissions are currently happening, and finds that there are
none (because it is out of range of <code>C</code>). So <code>A</code> goes ahead and sends data to
<code>B</code>. Now <code>B</code> can&rsquo;t understand either data packet because they collided and
interfered with each other in an unrecoverable way because they were both sent
in the same channel.</p>

<p>I think the porch scenario is simply an example of the <em>Hidden Terminal
Problem</em> above. In my room, my laptop can hear many of my neighbors&#8217; WiFi LAN
networks, but it&rsquo;s the same set that my WiFi router sitting in the closet can
hear. However outside, where there&rsquo;s less cause for signal attenuation, my
laptop can hear many more WiFi LAN networks than the router inside. So the
router checks whether there is congestion, doesn&rsquo;t hear any, and sends the
data. But there <em>is</em>, in fact, congestion, and my computer doesn&rsquo;t receive the
data properly. The data is therefore not <em>ACKd</em>, the router times out on the
<em>ACK</em>, and has to retransmit, and so on. This makes for a <em>far</em> slower
Hinterconnectivity outside on the porch than in my room.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson learnt is that the WiFi router should be situated in a place
where it can hear more of the outside noise so that it can compensate better
for that noise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In order to align a data structure at the nearest word-alignment to a given
starting address, we&rsquo;d must find the smallest multiple of N (a power of 2)
which is greater than or equal to integer X. Is there a way we can <em>make this
fast</em>, i.e. not use division or modulo?</p>

<h2>First Thoughts</h2>

<h3>First of all</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Otherwise, we have two cases</h3>

<h4>First Case</h4>

<pre><code>N: 00100
X: 01100
--------
=&gt; 01100
</code></pre>

<p>This example indicates the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Second Case</h4>

<pre><code>N: 00100       
X: 01101       
--------       
=&gt; 10000       
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be accomplished by</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we have the first-take program of</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing the readings for my <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/classes/F15-CS386W/">Wireless Networking course</a> at
UTexas, and in the process have dug into much of the basics of radios and
networks that I had ignored in the past. Here, I will try briefly describe what
I have learned. Maybe not everything I will say here is exactly correct, but I
think it&rsquo;s at least <em>mostly</em> correct.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to start somewhere near the beginning. Our <strong>goal</strong> is to transfer a
<em>information</em> from one location <code>LocSND</code> to another <code>LocRCV</code> <em>conveniently</em>.
The way we will accomplish that is by having <code>LocSND</code> manipulate the
<em>electromagnetic field</em> around <code>LocRCV</code>. More specifically, we will <em>encode</em> a
binary <em>dataframe</em> as <em>modulations</em> of a <em>radio signal</em> around a pre-determined
<em>carrier frequency</em>.</p>

<p>How do we <em>do</em> that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>How I Found it</h3>

<p>I was watching a biography of Richard Feynman, and they interviewed this guy W.
Daniel Hillis, and he seemed like a cool dude so I looked him up on Google, and
came across his book, <strong><em>The Pattern in the Stone: The Simple Ideas that Make
Computers Work</em></strong> (1999). On Amazon it was compared to <strong><em>Code: The Hidden
Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em></strong>, by Charles Petzold, an
encredibly well- written book about how computers work. I would gladly read any
book considered comparable in lucidity to <em>Code</em>, so I got <em>The Pattern in the
Stone</em>.</p>

<h3>What it says</h3>

<p>The first few chapters are meant to give a basic understanding of what a
computer is actually doing, and he spends some time noting the Universality of
computers, which he says shows that &ldquo;all computers are alike in what they can
and cannot do&rdquo;. Personally, my intuition of the workings of a computer comes
mainly from an explanation by Richard Feynman himself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA">as seen on the
YouTubes</a>) which is &ldquo;heuristic&rdquo; rather than mechanical. Basically
Feynman gradually turns a human being into a computer, and then talks about how
this mechanistic person can be implemented using logic gates built from water
pipes that he sketches on a whiteboard. In <em>Pattern in the Stone&#8221;</em>, he builds
logic gates out of parallel and series wires, and also out of springs and
pivots.</p>

<p>Then he introduces finite state machines and programming in LOGO. Then he
mentions how machine code can be thought of as <em>control instructions</em>,
specifying the next instruction to fetch and execute, and <em>processing
instructions</em>, moving data to and from memory, and through the Arithmetic Logic
Unit.</p>

<p>Then he starts really getting into what I think is the main point of the book,
to convince the reader that there is no magical process occurring in our brains
that a mechanical computer cannot replicate, meaning that</p>

<blockquote><p>As far as we know, no device built in the physical universe can have any more
computational power than a Turing machine&hellip;[so] a universal computer with
the proper programming should be able to simulate the function of a human
brain.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>My &ldquo;Learning&rdquo; Workflow</h3>

<p>As I wrote about <a href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/how-apm-originally-worked/">before</a>, I have developed an interesting method of learning
from experts, which can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork their repo on GitHub</li>
<li>Clone the repo locally and &ldquo;detach the <code>HEAD</code>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;inital commmit&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now repeat the following <code>while (curious)</code>

<ol>
<li>Open the working tree in an editor/IDE</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s something runnable, run it</li>
<li>Understand everything going on in the working tree

<ul>
<li>Take hints from the commit message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advance <code>HEAD</code> one commit</li>
<li>View the diff from the previous commit</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few days I have been learning how <code>apm</code>, the Atom Package Manager
works under the hood. <code>apm</code> is what you use when, in GitHub&rsquo;s (relatively new)
&ldquo;Atom&rdquo; text editor, you go to the nice gui package installation interface under
<code>settings=&gt;packages</code>.</p>

<p>Atom is a &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; text editor built on top of Chromium, using Node.js and
Coffeescript. I believe they call it hackable because all the code is open
source, and you can add plugins to do whatever you want. Your plugins can even
be written in C++ if that&rsquo;s more your style.</p>

<p>My goal was to figure out how <code>apm</code> works, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure how best to do
that. My knowledge of Node.js was minimal, and I was no expert in Coffeescript.
What I decided to do was fork the <code>apm</code> GitHub repo, clone it onto my computer,
and set my local HEAD to the <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/b8f4ce0d0cda458853eb280fde39fdeb2de38ebd">&ldquo;initial commit&rdquo;</a>, and see if I could
understand that. The complete contents are as follows</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>README.md</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'># APM - Atom Package Manager
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Discover and install Atom packages.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this stage I pretty confident that I understood everthing the author Kevin
Sawicki was doing. Lucky for me, it seems Kevin is rather unique on GitHub&rsquo;s
Atom development team for having smaller commits. I can justify this by noting
that on Atom-core&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/graphs/contributors">list of developer contributions</a>, he has 2x more
commits than the next guy, but is not in the top 5 in terms of LOC added.</p>

<p>So with my head fully wrapped around the &ldquo;initial commit&rdquo; I moved my HEAD past
the 2nd commit (a typo fix) into the first commit of any substance, <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/31294702b11061e60214357f4529fb9b00a7068d">&ldquo;Add
initial Gruntfile, binary, and ignores&rdquo;</a>. At this point there was some
investigation to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Getting to the same page</h3>

<p>When a colleague and I are in a discussion about something and both start to
get very excited about where it is going, I start to believe that we both must
be seeing things in the same way. This is a fantasy. You start to feel that
&ldquo;connection&rdquo;; it gets palpable. It feels like we&rsquo;re really communicating
consciousness to consciousness. It feels like thoughts are pipelining across
thin air. Sometimes it&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;d posit that usually it is not. And this
misunderstanding of the true level of agreement can later be a cause of grief.
You feel like the other person abandoned your shared vision when they take the
result of your conversation and make something different from what you
intended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After some further thought, it has become clear that my previous post about
abstractions and what makes them good got it all wrong. There, I said roughly
that an abstraction is something that allows you to simplify a hard mental task
to make that task easier. This needs to be reevaluated. The earlier post
claimed that a hammer is an improper abstraction for opening up a package. That
just doesn&rsquo;t sound right. A hammer is nothing more than a bad <em>tool</em> for
opening up a package. A <em>tool</em> is something that makes a task easier. A tool
and an abstraction are not equivalent.</p>

<p>My Software Architecture professor began the semester by giving us about 20
very similar definitions of what software architecture is, to give us a general
sense of what people are talking about. I left the lecture equally uninformed
about what software architecture is, but did eventually come to grips with it.
With the Sisyphean nature of the task now understood, I would like to propose a
new definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>An abstraction is a way of conceptualizing something without having to think
about everything that is actually going on. If we think in terms of the
abstraction, we can arrive at the same conclusions as could have been derived
using the &ldquo;underlying truth of the matter&rdquo; without as much mental effort.
After communicating the chain of logic using the abstraction, the listener
would also be able to derive the result by substituting the abstraction out
for the &ldquo;underlying truth&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is basically a mental shorthand.</p>
