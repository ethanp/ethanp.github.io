### Introduction

My hope is that this website shall become a place where stuff I've been up to
and thinking about gets documented. The plan is for it to also have tutorials
on how to do things, especially if I could not find a good explanation for
myself. I'm a man of few words, so it may start out a little forced and
certainly not well written; that's okay though.

### octopress

For the formatting of this blog, I have chosen
[octopress][octlink] because it is quite simple to integrate
with `username.github.io` or Heroku, and the code-formatting quality built-in
looks pretty top-notch. So far I'm liking it because it took very little
effort to set up. Although now I've got all the default styling in place,
I imagine it's very customizable for when that's what I want to do.

### Going forward

So here's what I plan to put on here:

1. Stuff I made/am making
2. Stuff I learned/am learning
3. How-to do-cool-stuff
4. I don't know

I'm a bit worried I'll just start spouting opinions about what I like and what
I don't like, but I will do my best to avoid devolving to that, though it's
surprisingly hard to stay away from that.  Instead, I'd like to keep it as
substantive/informative as I can.
