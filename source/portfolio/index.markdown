## [javascript-whackamole](https://github.com/ethanp/javascript-whackamole)

It's multiplayer-ready game, but currently only works for a single person against the computer. I made it to have a game to hook up to `playframework` and make it truly multiplayer via `websocket`. That's still `TODO` though....

It uses Bootstrap because I don't know any better and jQuery because it makes
the code look cool.

### Here are some screenshots of the game in action

## [Django-AudioFiles](https://github.com/ethanp/Django-AudioFiles)

First, use WebRTC to record audio from client's microphone into a Javascript
`Blob` in the browser. Then upload the `Blob` to the server and store it as a
file with Django.
