    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months, I wrote a kind of crappy program. Now I need to make
additions to that program and there is a lot of internals about the program
that I need to recall to be able to implement the additions efficiently and
robustly. This is not a world I want to continue to live in, so my crappy
program requires improvement. No one I asked had advice that I could put into
practice, so I looked to Amazon for a book with the answers on &ldquo;what
<em>specifically</em> to do&rdquo;. Based on its cover, title, and reviews, I ended up with
the book <strong>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</strong>, put
together from multiple authors by a guy who refers to himself as &ldquo;Uncle Bob&rdquo;.
The book is frankly a big part of the answer I was looking for.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about Uncle Bob, but he seems to be <em>very</em>
experienced with designing, writing, maintaining, refactoring, etc. large Java
projects. He also is very well-read on modern software engineering, but
manages to stay away from the over-use of terminology I&rsquo;m not familiar with.
He also talks about his conversations with (the only) guys in this arena that
I have heard of, including Fred Brooks and Martin Fowler.</p>

<p>His writing tone can be characterized as follows, &ldquo;I have read and written
sooo much more code than you, and over time, I have taken the time to think
about the best way to make the code &#8220;clean&rdquo;. Herein, I shall share with you
what I have learned, using the best didactic methods I can think of. I hope
you benefit as much as possible from my wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far (over the past 3 days) I have read perhaps 1/3 of the book, but I have
already come up with a design for my program that is <strong>so much</strong> better than
the old design, and a rough prototype implementation is already running. That
is an incredible return on investment.</p>

<p>The main thing I have understood from the book is that <strong>parts of programs
should do what they say they do</strong>. Put most-briefly, there are two parts of
making that possible</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Components should be simple enough to be described by just a few words</strong></li>
<li><strong>The <em>name</em> of a component should be the few words that describe it</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>It is embarrassing to say that I never thought of that myself, but the truth
is I didn&rsquo;t, and that is reflected all-too-obviously in the program that I
wrote. I can come up with countless excuses for why I wrote the program that
way, but that doesn&rsquo;t fix the problem. The only way to fix the problem is to
reorganize the program to conform to the above two rules.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My program is a pipeline that takes multiple data sources, transforms them,
mashes them together, and writes them to multiple locations. It does this in a
somewhat resilient way by using Kafka as an internal buffer and data bus.
However you can&rsquo;t tell from the structure of the program that that is what is
going on.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m using Scala, the new design makes this look more like a Unix
program:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of code required to create those interfaces and methods.
Basically any number of <code>DataSink[T]</code>s can be &ldquo;observers&rdquo; of a
<code>DataSource[T]</code>. So now we have an asynchronous, &ldquo;reactive&rdquo;, typesafe pipeline
where components can be swapped in an out by data sources calling their
<code>publishMsgs(msgs: Seq[T])</code> method, and data sinks implementing their
<code>receiveMsgs(msgs: Seq[T])</code> function.</p>

<p>The biggest influence on this design is the Akka Streaming library, which I
have not tried out yet. Instead of taking the time to learn it, I have
implemented a very basic version of their design. Of course the Akka team
didn&rsquo;t invent the design either, it is similar to &ldquo;flow-based programming&rdquo;
which is in-turn inspired by the practice of electrical engineering.</p>

<p>With this approach, each component has a single responsibility: to produce the
data it says it does, or merge the two types it says it does, or write a type
to the place it says it does. Then in the &ldquo;main&rdquo; function we just assemble the
data flow of the program.</p>

<p>In this model, a Kafka topic can be implemented as an object (i.e. Singleton)
that has two ends: a producer (which is a DataSink, since it writes data out of
the program), and a corresponding consumer (a DataSource for the program).</p>

<p>So if the program has two &ldquo;main&rdquo; functions, one connects to the producer side
of a Kafka topic, and the other connects to the consumer side, all using this
Unix-like Scala DSL, then we have integrated Kafka as a resilient buffer
connecting two stages of the pipeline. This means the consumer side can be
taken offline for fixing or augmentation without losing ephemeral data
collected by the producer side.</p>

<p>Because I haven&rsquo;t thought this through completely or written the code yet,
there is still room for fundamental issues to come up with plugging this model
into my codebase which will make it impossible for this major refactoring to
complete, but what I expect is that this model allows us to express what is
really going in such a way that by looking at the <em>names</em> of the components, we
know <em>what</em> is going on <em>where</em>.</p>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/04/10/bigtable-paper-summary/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-10T22:02:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/04/10/bigtable-paper-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When looking into what Cassandra and HBase are, and their relative strengths
and weaknesses, people often seem to think they can get away with the
following very succinct characterizations: &ldquo;Cassandra is like is Dynamo plus
Bigtable, and HBase is just Bigtable&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know much about Dynamo <em>or</em>
BigTable because we skipped those papers in my systems courses. So to get
started understanding what&rsquo;s going on with all this mess, I decided to read
the Bigtable paper. What follows is a brief summarization/retelling of the
<a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf">Bigtable paper</a>. It follows roughly the form of the paper, especially in
that it starts high level, and then digs slightly lower-down into the
implementation. It contains basically only and all of the parts of the paper
that I found illuminating, but broken down into sentences that are hopefully
easier to understand.</p>

<h3>What problem are we solving?</h3>

<p>Bigtable provides an API for storing and retrieving data.</p>

<p>It is most useful if</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a <em>lot</em> of data coming in at a high rate over time</li>
<li>there is no need to join each data table with another</li>
<li>data might need to be updated</li>
<li>range queries are common</li>
</ul>


<p>Bigtable is a distributed database. It is a database management system which
allows you to define tables, write and update data, and run queries against
the stored data. It is similar to a relational database, except that it is not
&ldquo;relational&rdquo; in the sense denoted by the term &ldquo;relational database&rdquo;. Instead,
it brings its own type of data model, where instead of storing data in normal
two-dimensional table cells, you store it according to a new set of rules that
allows for flexibility in the shape of each record, while still enabling
overall efficiency.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Go on&hellip;</h3>

<p>In the Bigtable data model, data is grouped in tables. Each record in one
table must have a string identifier unique in that table. Each table is
defined to have a set of &ldquo;column families&rdquo;. This is where the data goes. A
record has values, that is the point of having a record. Each of those values
is associated with a timestamp when it was created. This can either be defined
by Bigtable or by the user inserting the data. Having two versions of a record
means it was updated. Each value has its own key (a string) pointing to it.
That key has two components, a &ldquo;family&rdquo; and a &ldquo;qualifier&rdquo;. Each table has a
finite set of families with known names. However, the qualifier segment of a
value&rsquo;s key may be an arbitrary string. There may be any number of anchors for
each family in each record. You can hint whether you want Bigtable to prefer
disk locality when writing many values in the same column family.</p>

<p>Rows are stored on disk in alphabetically by row key, and for each value, in
<em>descending</em> order of timestamps (i.e. most recent first). All reads and
writes over a single key are atomic with respect to each other, but not with
respect to changes in other rows. (This is something the client must be
careful about.) All the rows for a given table are chopped up (dynamically)
into &ldquo;tablets&rdquo; which each are stored in by exactly one &ldquo;tablet server&rdquo; node in
the cluster. One can specify garbage collection to either only keep the last
<em>n</em> versions, or to only keep everything for a specified duration.</p>

<p>When reading the data, one might e.g. just fetch the data for one column
family within a particular range of row names, but get all currently known
versions of that data. This type of query is what was optimized by the
creators of Bigtable. One might for example want to execute this type of query
to feed as input to a MapReduce job. One could do that, and then also be able
to enjoy the intentionally efficient writing of MapReduce results into a
different Bigtable table.</p>

<p>Bigtable data is stored in the SSTable file format. In this format, each file
represents what in Scala would be called a <code>immutable.Map[String, String]</code>. A
file is made of blocks, each containing a continuous interval of the keys that
is listed in the file&rsquo;s &ldquo;block index&rdquo;. Each SSTable file is stored in Google
File System (GFS), which I will not describe in detail here, and is similar to
the Hadoop File System (HDFS).</p>

<p>Bigtable relies on Chubby (similar to Apache Zookeeper) to ensure there is &ldquo;at
most one active aster at any time&rdquo; and for bootstrapping.</p>

<p>A Bigtable instance has a single master node, and a potentially dynamic number
of tablet servers. A tablet is a complete alphabetical interval of all the
data in a table. The master manages tablet assignment, server cluster
membership changes (with help from Chubby), load-balancing of tablets among servers, garbage
collection, and schema changes. The tablet server handles read and write
requests to its tablets, and splits tablets when they get too big.</p>

<p>Clients only need to communicate with the master to find the relevant tablet
servers. The relative amount of this sort of communication compared to the
actual data transfers is such that this practice is not a system-wide
bottleneck. Clients also cache this data until a server says the information
is stale.</p>

<p>Tablet location information (across all tables being managed by a single
Bigtable instance) is stored in one big 3-level hierarchical B+-tree type
thing (i.e. it&rsquo;s a sorted <em>n</em>-way tree, where you go down the appropriate
pointer from an internal node based on what it says about the interval of row
IDs contained in its leaves. The root is stored in Chubby. At the third level
I think you have the locations of all the tablets and what keys are owned by
each.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, persistent tablet state is stored in GFS, but what is
that &ldquo;tablet state&rdquo;. Each write or update is appended a commit log (with a
unique mutation identifier to resolve duplication caused by tricky crash
scenarios). It also modifies the (copy-on-write) in-memory representation of
the current state of this chunk of the table. One can always reconstruct the
in-memory representation by playing back the commit log, but ideally most
reads are serviced from memory. Every once in a while the in-memory state gets
too big, and <em>it</em> is written out as an SSTable into GFS. Every once in a
while, multiple SSTables are read back into, and since some might be updates
to others, they are merged together, and the sources deleted.</p>

<p>In practice, the authors found that applying a very computationally efficient
compression algorithm (rather than one with a top-notch compression ratio)
increased overall system efficiency in many cases. They also added bloom
filters to the SSTables to reduce the number of unecessary disk reads of non-
existent data.</p>

<p>The paper says Google has used Bigtable as a backend for its Google Analytics
product, Google Earth, Personalized Search, and storing websites for
retrieving results for its Search Engine.</p>

<p>As future work they want to be able to provide better (but not full) support
for transactions (I think this is addressed in the Spanner paper released a
few years later).</p>

<p>Their lessons learned include</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;delay adding new features until it is clear how the new features will be
used&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;the importance of proper system-level monitoring&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;the value of simple designs&hellip;code and design clarity are of immennse
help in code maintenance and debugging&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>They conclude by noting that this system bears some resemblance to the C-Store
column-oriented database system, for which there is another good paper that I
ought to finish reading at some point. They also note that people who are used
to &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; relational databases find the Bigtable interface awkward, but
that it works so much better than the alternatives that people end up using it
anyway.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>What is a server and how does it relate to my Rails app?</h1>

<p>I learned the basics of Ruby on Rails web application development a few years
ago. At that time, my understanding how that system works was as follows</p>

<ol>
<li>Find articles describing things Rails allows you to do easily</li>
<li>Decide on an app that requires only those things</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in those articles to implement your app idea</li>
<li>Push the app to Heroku</li>
<li>Now the app is accessible to anyone on the World Wide Web</li>
</ol>


<p>The fact that it is <em>so</em> easy to do such a thing is nothing short of magical.
Especially while you have <em>no idea</em> how any of it works. Now that I am
slightly more knowledgeable about how software systems are put together and
deployed, I&rsquo;d like to take a slightly more nuanced stab at what really was
going on when the above 5 steps were executed.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>How Rails makes things so easy</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails was created out of frustration with &ldquo;heavyweight&rdquo; web
application development frameworks, such as ones from the late 90&rsquo;s that use
Java. It gives you base-classes for all the important parts of your program so
that you only need to write (and even <em>see</em>) code for the pieces that are
unique to your system. It generates a base project with everything you need
already included in a well-structured layout that helps you make sense of what
is going on. Through some clever usage of the Ruby programming language, it
creates methods named after the components you implemented, and makes them
available in the places you may need them. This has led to a culture of
natural-language inspired community-built APIs that enable you to easily do
things only the most modern websites have.</p>

<h2>How does traffic get into and out of Rails?</h2>

<p>Maybe there is another way to do it, but at least by default Rails uses Rack.
Rack is a &ldquo;webserver interface&rdquo;. A Rack application has a Ruby object that has
a method that receives parsed HTTP requests in a well-specified format, and
then calls a method (called <code>call</code>) which receives the parsed HTTP request as
a Ruby object, and returns a parsed HTTP response in a well-specified format
(specifically a Ruby array structured like <code>[response_code, {headers_map},
[body_lines]]</code>).</p>

<p>A Rails application implements Rack&rsquo;s <code>call</code> method. What that <code>call</code> method
actually returns for any given HTTP request argument is defined by all your
Rails code, e.g. your router, controllers, models, views, etc.</p>

<h3>What about Rack then?</h3>

<p>Fine, now we understand that Rack passes the HTTP request to Rails, and Rails
returns the HTTP response to Rack. But how did Rack get the HTTP request in
the first place? Answer: from a Web Server.</p>

<p>A web server suitable for Rack would be a program that</p>

<ul>
<li>listens on a TCP port</li>
<li>connects to clients on that port</li>
<li>receives the HTTP requests from those clients</li>
<li>parses them into the format that Rack expects</li>
<li>Calls the Rack method <code>call</code> using that format</li>
<li>Receives the HTTP response from Rack</li>
<li>Converts that into the raw HTTP response format</li>
<li>Sends the response to the client</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many such suitable web servers, such as Unicorn and Thin.</p>

<h3>So what is nginx?</h3>

<p>It seems to me that one does not typically use nginx to call Rack&rsquo;s <code>call</code>
method (though this might be possible to do). One typically uses nginx as a
waypoint of traffic bound for the application, but in need of some sort of
pre-processing. That pre-processing could take multiple forms. Maybe there is
a cache sitting outside of Rails itself, and nginx can be setup to return
results from the cache instead of proxying requests into the server which
interacts with Rails itself. This will improve performance for each client who
hits such a cache, and will increase the load the system is capable of
supporting overall. Nginx might know of multiple servers connected to
different instances of the Rails app running concurrently, and will choose
which server to send each request to in such a way as to distribute load
across the Rails applications (&ldquo;load balancing&rdquo;). Nginx might &ldquo;terminate SSL&rdquo;,
meaning that clients connect to the address on which nginx is listening, and
will send their request to nginx over the TLS protocol, but nginx will decrypt
that request before passing it wherever it will go next; then nginx will
encrypt the response according to the TLS state and the client will know how
to decrypt the response (and ideally no one else will know how to decrypt it).</p>

<h2>What Heroku does</h2>

<p>Using the simple <code>git push heroku</code> workflow, Heroku takes care of all the
aspects of managing the deployment of your Rails server. It will provide a
virtual server to run your Rails code. It will provide a server which speaks
Rack to receive requests, invoke your Rails code, and return the response to
the client. It has DNS entries installed in the relevant places on the
internet so that you can choose a name for your app to be accessed by your
friends in their homes using their browsers. It will do a whole lot more, such
as autoscaling, caching, and other things beyond the scope of this post
because I don&rsquo;t know about them.</p>

    <updated>2016-04-09T13:45:39-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/04/09/simple-first-deployment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just had my first experience of &ldquo;deploying my system into production&rdquo;. I
have been learning about software engineering for a few years now, and I have
seen this term &ldquo;deploy into production&rdquo; many times, but never experienced it
myself. The &ldquo;software system&rdquo; that was deployed is an internal tool, almost 3
months in development by yours truly. This article is a retrospective of the
development of this system so far.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The system itself uses many APIs with which I was previously unfamiliar;
Kafka, Elasticsearch, HDFS, ZooKeeper, Spray, CouchDB, etc.; but I have glued
together unfamiliar APIs on many previous occasions. The system is
&ldquo;distributed&rdquo; and has in-built fault-tolerance in various ways; but I have
included that feature in previous projects. The thing that is new for me about
this project is that it was written with maintainability as a goal, and
&ldquo;released&rdquo; in such a way that it runs continuously as a service, and its
output can serve as input for the daily work of other human beings. This is my
first project for my first job, and it is finally working.</p>

<p>There were <em>many</em> times during the development of this project when I figured
it would probably be deployed within the next few days. At those points, I
told my manager to begin finding me something interesting to work on next. He
always sounded more skeptical than I expected about the project actually being
nearly done. On each of those occasions, I realized within the next few hours
after announcing my near-completion, that there was still, in fact, a <em>slew</em>
of components still needing to be worked out before the software could be
deployed, and that I had <em>no idea</em> how to craft any of these components.</p>

<p>There are <em>too many</em> guides out there about how to develop and deploy software
systems. For me, the most important ended up being <a href="https://medium.com/@jlouis666/how-to-build-stable-systems-6fe9dcf32fc4">a Medium article</a> by
Jesper L. Andersen (no idea who that is). I think I found the article on Hacker
News a month and a half ago. I will summarize my takaways from it</p>

<ul>
<li>The developer is responsible for every aspect of the software</li>
<li>Make sure the project makes sense to tackle</li>
<li>Choose the right libraries, frameworks etc. to use

<ul>
<li>This requires a small amount of experimentation which should be done up
front in a separated/extracted code-base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit scope

<ul>
<li>E.g. create a list of problems you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> solving</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit external dependencies</li>
<li>Create a transition plan from the previous system to the new one</li>
<li>Design for future extension</li>
<li>Prefer correctness and elegance to efficiency of execution

<ul>
<li>This is especially true for my project because it is network bound anyway</li>
<li>But still, understand which parts must be more correct than others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collect metrics about system performance</li>
<li>Write automated tests of whether

<ul>
<li>The components that need to do something correctly are</li>
<li>The different components of the system can communicate with each other
effectively</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There are still aspects of my system that are not perfect. For example, I
occasionaly see errors about a timeout in some library used by a library I am
using. I don&rsquo;t know whether those errors are corrupting my data, or killing
JVM threads, or whatever else. The system is already a vast improvement over
what was in place before in terms of correctness and latency of the data
produced, so having the occasional issue was not a good enough reason to delay
deployment any further.</p>

<p>The system was deployed in a manner one might describe as &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;. I rsync
the code onto a server, build the code on the server, open up two <code>tmux</code>
windows, run one JVM which produces to Kafka, run another JVM which consumes
from Kafka, make sure everything that is <em>supposed</em> to be happening <em>is</em>
happening, and detach from tmux. According to the blog post I linked above, it
is desirable to be able to hit a button and see it deploy itself
automatically. In my case this conflicts with the other suggestion in that
article, which is to stick to limit the number of things you have to learn in
order to get the first version of your software working, which I believe the
author meant to be more important than a one-click deployment scheme.</p>

<p>The system is not exactly &ldquo;done&rdquo; in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t have all the
features it is supposed to have. But at least I know now that the system works
in its production environment and is able to interact successfully and
(demonstrably) correctly with all the external infrastructure that it relies
upon. But to be sure, many corners were cut, many pieces are <em>kind of</em> there
but not really, the metrics are not collected well, and configurations (e.g.
of Kafka, ZooKeeper, and Elasticsearch) were chosen on a &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll probably get
us running&rdquo; basis. As it turns out, there have already been issues with
Elasticsearch not being able to handle the load of multiple of my colleagues
querying it at once.</p>

<p>A problem with having deployed it without a larger share of the issues worked-
out is that I now need to be more careful to make my changes behave as
transitions from &ldquo;working state&rdquo; to &ldquo;working state&rdquo;. There are pieces of the
system that if they are left not-working for more than 24 hours, data will be
irretrievably lost, and people will be sad. But by design of the software, the
piece that <em>must</em> be left running properly is mostly disentangled from the
rest of the system, so that it can run while the rest of the system is
offline, and none of the data will be lost. This is accomplished by buffering
data in Kafka.</p>

<p>Since I have no previous experience deploying a software system like this, I
did not have a good basis to evaluate which libraries to build my system upon,
except for the buzz that I see on Hacker News, and my own intuition and
background. I like the Scala programming language best, and because of Spark,
some people I work with already use Scala, so I chose Scala. Is Go a better
tool for the job? According to the relative buzzes of the two ecosystems on
Hacker News, maybe it is. Would Docker have provided a better mechanism for
deployment? Most-likely it would have, but that can be added at any time if it
turns out that deployment is a <em>problem</em> which needs to be <em>solved</em>, which at
this simple stage, it is not.</p>

<p>It is exciting to final have real people relying on code that I wrote. I am
excited to continue making this system better-meet the needs of its users. I
am even more excited by the shift in the way I look at writing software now
that I have seen more of the lifecycle of a single project.</p>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/03/06/what-actually-is-ssh/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-06T14:18:53-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/03/06/what-actually-is-ssh</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>SSH Tunneling</h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;Tunnelling&rdquo;, with two ells, is the British spelling.</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, I downloaded a tool (an ELK stack) that didn&rsquo;t work right
off the bat due to some sort of misconfiguration. It was running in a Vagrant-
made virtual machine (VM) on my laptop. The Vagrant setup script had forwarded
a local port on my laptop into the VM. So in order to debug it, my coworker
configured a chain of tunnels that enabled him to SSH into the VM on my
laptop.</p>

<p>In the back of my mind, I spent the next few weeks trying to figure out what
SSH port-forwarding is and how its syntax works, then another few weeks to
figure out what reverse port-forwarding is, and another few weeks to find
practical use-cases for each.</p>

<p>Here is my executive summary</p>

<pre><code>ssh -L [&lt;localhost&gt;:]&lt;localport&gt;:&lt;remotehost&gt;:&lt;remoteport&gt; &lt;gateway&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By default, <code>&lt;localhost&gt;</code> will be <code>localhost</code>.</p>

<p>What this does is, start a serversocket listening to local address
<code>localhost:localport</code> using the &ldquo;SSH client&rdquo;. When a client establishes a
connection to that address, traffic received from that client will be
encrypted, and forwarded to the <code>sshd</code>[aemon] listening on port 22 of
<code>gateway</code>. (Only) after the gateway receives this traffic, the <code>sshd</code> will
establish a (normal, unencrypted) connection to remote address
<code>remotehost:remoteport</code>, and forward the data originally received by the SSH
client there. Response traffic originating from <code>remotehost:remoteport</code> will
go back to the <code>sshd</code>, back through the encrypted tunnel to the SSH client,
and back to the originating client.</p>

<p><em>Reverse</em> tunneling by contrast, means that traffic <em>originating</em> on the
remote end will be forwarded to the local end.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s SSH</h2>

<p>One thing that confused me about SSH forwarding, is that if I don&rsquo;t use some
extra flags to disable it, when I set up port forwarding to a another machine,
I also end up with a shell ready executing commands remotely. What is going on
here? It turns out it is doing what is called &ldquo;remote command execution&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening: SSH is capable of multiplexing multiple communication
&ldquo;channels&rdquo; over a single encrypted TCP connection. If you just execute the
normal tunneling command given above, it will create two channels, one for
forwarding the tcp traffic, and another for executing commands visually in
your pseudo-terminal but physically in a remote shell.</p>

<p>When you <code>ssh</code> onto a remote machine, a particular sequence of things happen
that I think really clarify what the heck&rsquo;s going on. You can see it happening
if you turn on verbose mode (<code>-v</code>).</p>

<ol>
<li>You connect via TCP to the standard SSH-daemon port (22) on the remote
machine</li>
<li>You authenticate it via its public key

<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s why the first time you connect is says &ldquo;do you want to trust this
server&rsquo;s fingerprint?&rdquo; or something like that (I think saying &ldquo;yes I
trust it&rdquo; implies you have verified that the fingerprint does not belong
to a <em>man-in-the-middle</em> attacker)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It authenticates you, either by you supplying a password, or by it finding
your username in its <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, and [using what protocol?] you match it with your private key</li>
<li>Y&#8217;all negotiate an encryption for the session, over which future
communications will take place

<ul>
<li>[Maybe you have to choose a specific cryptographic algorithm like in TLS?]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that communications are encrypted, control and channel data are
transferred using a binary packet format that contains

<ul>
<li>Encrypted packet length &mdash; answers: when does this packet end?</li>
<li>Various random paddings &mdash; to fool the bad guys</li>
<li>The encrypted (and possibly compressed) payload &mdash; here&rsquo;s the good stuff</li>
<li>A message authentication code (MAC) &mdash; find evidence of corruption/tampering</li>
<li>Recipient&rsquo;s integer identifier for this channel &mdash; answers: what <em>channel</em>
did this data come in from?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To setup a remote shell, your SSH client requests permission to create a
special channel specifically designed for the purpose of remote shells

<ul>
<li>At this point you tell the server which ID you&rsquo;re allocating to this
channel, so that it knows how to fill the last item in the format
specified above</li>
<li>Since each channel performs its own flow-control, you also state your
&ldquo;window size&rdquo; (similar to TCP)

<ul>
<li>Both sides maintain a receive window, and once the sender has sent
enough bytes to fill it, they will not send more data until you say
that your window now has more room</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the server supports &ldquo;shell&rdquo; channels, it will tell you which ID it
allocates for the new shell channel

<ul>
<li>so that you can put the correct ID in SSH packets in this channel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then you tell the server your psuedo-terminal&rsquo;s display specifics

<ul>
<li>characters horizontally and vertically, as well as pixels horizontally and
vertically</li>
<li>If you were using X11, you would tell the server your screen&rsquo;s specifics</li>
<li>If your dimensions change, you can send an update message to the server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now you can send the server the values of environment variables to use</li>
<li>Then you request that the server initiate a shell in which to execute the
commands you&rsquo;re going to give it. You can specify the path to the specific
shell to use.</li>
<li>Then you start sending commands to execute, which the server will pass to
the shell it created</li>
<li>The server will send you back output received from the shell, formatted
for your terminal</li>
<li>You can also send signals for the server to pass to its shell</li>
<li>When the remote shell command terminates, the server will send you its
&ldquo;exit-status&rdquo;, or if there was a violent termination, it will send an
&ldquo;exit-signal&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<p>Note this communication only used one channel, and there can be however many
channels open over the same SSH connection. This is implemented using the
framing layer that puts the data into the higher-level datagram format
described in list item 5 above. Datagrams are then demultiplexed by the
receiver according to the the channel identifiers in the datagram. So one
channel might be used for forwarding packets received on a port registered
with SSH for forwarding, while another is used for the normal SSH remote shell
execution terminals. So that&rsquo;s how we see the effects of the &ldquo;-L&rdquo; feature of
SSH described in the beginning.</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s like HTTP/2</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know many protocols, so a lot of this stuff is new territory for me.
When I got curious, to find out more, I started by reading the Wikipedia page,
because in addition to having its explanation, it often has good references
and links to related topics. From there I followed the reference to the IETF
RFC. Maybe it was because I read the Wikipedia page first, but I found the RFC
much easier to follow, and with a better enunciation of what is going on than
the Wikipedia page. I didn&rsquo;t read the RFC word for word except for the first
few sections, but then, based on its structure and formatting, was able to
find the pieces I was interested in surprisingly fast. The reason for that is
the RFC&rsquo;s authors are familiar with explaning such concepts, and spent months
working as a team to increase the document&rsquo;s utter clarity to reduce the
possibility of miscommunication.</p>

<p>In a previous post I looked at the new HTTP/2 IETF RFC. That protocol contains
a similar framing layer over TCP that allows it to multiplex multiple channels
concurrently over a single underlying TCP socket. IIRC, the reason for that
was to ease issues with &ldquo;head-of-line blocking&rdquo;, which is where one channel&rsquo;s
being slow ends up slowing down all the other channels because of TCP
unecessarily guaranteeing maintaining FIFO order of packets across multiplexed
channels that have no globally-defined order. At the same time opening up many
TCP connections per client is undesirable for the server. So after having seen
this framing-layer thing in two protocols, now I understand it to be some sort
of &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; for allowing multiplexing communications over a single TCP link.
One big advantage is less connections per client on the server side. Also, the
TCP algorithm has a &ldquo;ramp up&rdquo; time, i.e. the congestion control starts out
with a rather pessimistic window size. By using only one socket, that ramp up
only must be done once. Surely, better knowledge of TCP would lead to more
insight here.</p>

<p>I like to get at least a basic idea of what my favorite tools are actually
doing. This sort of investigation can only go so far because the modern stack
of technologies is so vast and the &ldquo;lyfe so shorte&rdquo;. My first computer science
professor encouraged us to press the &ldquo;I believe&rdquo; button when something seemed
like magic. Still, lifting some of the veil on one tool I use everyday is
satisfying, and hopefully the time taken for others to get to my (still
minimal) level of understanding is reduced by the explanations above.</p>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/02/28/some-java-network-programming-fundamentals/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-28T15:15:13-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/02/28/some-java-network-programming-fundamentals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of what I&rsquo;ve learned and discussed here comes from <em>TCP/IP Sockets in
Java</em>, a highly recommended book about this stuff by Calvert and Donahoo. Some
of it also comes from <em>Java Network Programming</em> by Elliotte Rusty Harold.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <em>only</em> transport-layer protocols Java supports are TCP &amp; UDP; for
anything else, you must link to native code via the Java Native Interface</li>
<li>TCP uses <em>stream</em> sockets, through which one generally just writes to an
<code>OutputStream</code> and reads from an <code>InputStream</code> of bytes that remain in-order
and uncorrupted and are (practically) guaranteed delivery by the
implementation of the protocol by the operating system.

<ul>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;re using NIO; see below for more on that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UDP uses <em>datagram</em> sockets, through which you <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> objects
called <code>DatagramPacket</code>s, which are just a length, a destination, and data</li>
<li>Unless you&rsquo;re using NIO, everything <em>blocks</em>: e.g. connecting to servers,
listening for clients, reads, writes, and disconnecting (for TCP)

<ul>
<li>By default most of these actions may block <em>indefinitely</em></li>
<li>For reading and connecting, you can configure a timeout, after which you
will receive an <code>InterruptedIOException</code></li>
<li>For <em>writing</em> to a TCP stream, you <em>cannot</em> configure a timeout</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Handling multiple clients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Deal with one at a time, which is simplest, especially if there&rsquo;s some state
that is shared by all potential clients. Speed may become problematic
quickly.</li>
</ul>

otherwise. Threads sitting idle in the cache for over one minute are

<ul>
<li>Use NIO (rather complicated) to allow <code>N</code> threads to service <code>M</code>
clients, where <code>N</code> is small and <code>M</code> is huge. This uses event-based
programming. We can set all network operations to be non-blocking, and
only wait as long as we want to for them. An extensive example can be
found below.</li>
<li>Use a framework like Netty, Akka, etc. that wraps the NIO stuff up in a
ribbon and a tie</li>
</ul>


<h3>10K feet above NIO</h3>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using NIO, you create <code>Channel</code>s of bytes into and out of sockets
(or file handles)</li>
<li>You register a <code>Selector</code> to be notified when the <code>Channel</code> is ready to be
read from or written to</li>
<li>You query the <code>Selector</code> to tell you which <code>Channel</code> are ready, and may then
take action on those that are</li>
<li>You get data in and out by passing a <code>Buffer</code> to the <code>Channel</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Traps</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t write to the network through a <code>PrintStream</code>

<ul>
<li>It chooses end-of-line chars based on your platform, not the protocol
(HTTP uses <code>\r\n</code>)</li>
<li>It uses the default char encoding of your platform (likely UTF-8), not
whatever the server expects (likely UTF-8)</li>
<li>It eats all exceptions into this <code>boolean checkError()</code> method, when
you&rsquo;re better off just using the normal exception hubbub</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/02/27/asking-for-advice/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-27T15:38:06-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/02/27/asking-for-advice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many circumstances in life during which one may feel the need to ask
for advice. For example, when evaluating a significant decision, or when
dealing with an emotionally stressful circumstance. Here, I will discuss
advice about significant decisions.</p>

<p>In giving advice, everyone has a different approach. I generally try to follow
a line I heard in a rap song by The Streets, &ldquo;If you never tell a lie to her,
you don&rsquo;t have to remember anything.&rdquo; In other words, lying will only
complicate your life because you have to remember the lies you made up.
(Caveat: this may not always the best way to go for emotionally complex
issues.) I also enjoy helping people rationally and realistically evaluate
their options for significant decisions, and surely if someone recalls that
your input was helpful in the past, they will be more likely to ask you in the
future.</p>

<p>Most people I know don&rsquo;t seem to like giving useful advice. It seems they
either are (1) too afraid that their honesty will lead you to dislike them, or
(2) they feel so stressed with their own issues that taking on yours for a few
minutes would be overwhelming, or (3) they find your problem uninteresting and
simply have better things to do.</p>

<p>But some people are the opposite. They will patiently listen to your question
and give what they feel to be an honest evaluation of where you stand and what
you should do. The advice of people in this category will often be heavily and
obviously biased by their own experience and ideology. This is simply a
symptom of &ldquo;being honest&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So if you want good advice, it would be ideal to find someone who is honest,
not stressed about a similar problem to yours, as well as interested in and
knowledgeable of the subject; they should generally also be disinterested in
your particular problem. However, this ideal candidate is not always
available.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In that case one can obviously try the timeless &ldquo;pros vs cons&rdquo; list, which
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily rely on external sources of wisdom, but often external
sources of wisdom are critical. One can ask unideal candidates for advice, and
maybe they&rsquo;ll at least have some curt nugget that has some use. That&rsquo;s what I
usually do, and it is generally not effective at all, but occasionaly that
curt nugget is exactly the required pithy jewel.</p>

<p>One can consult the Internet, but I kind of assumed that if you needed advice,
you already checked the Internet for answers. But to go one step further you
can <em>ask</em> the Internet, treating it like this all knowing Oracle. This will
work to varying degrees depending on your problem. If your problem is one that
everyone and their mother has an opinion on, you will end up sifting through
junk answers, and may or may not get anything useful. In that case, the more
details you can reveal, the more benefit you will obtain. Of course <em>where</em>
you ask matters: for example Quora will be more effective than Yahoo Answers.
If your problem is esoteric, <em>find the people who are into that thing</em>.</p>

<p>For example, I have noticed to my surprise that StackOverflow/StackExchange is
not always the best place for all programming-related questions, because if
your question is esoteric to one technological ecosystem, the question-
answering population on StackOverflow won&rsquo;t necessarily have the flag-bearers
of the cause of that particular ecosystem. But if it really is an ecosystem,
it will have a place where the flag-bearers dwell, so <em>find it</em> and they will
probably help. In my experience, IRC channels tend to be empty; Gitter
channels may be well-attended; Github issues get a lot of flak for being a
mess, but are often effective if you&rsquo;re sure your question isn&rsquo;t stupid;
mailing lists can be high-latency but that&rsquo;s often where the true experts of
super-technical projects converse. Following <strong>good forum-question-asking
practices</strong> is <em>crucial</em> in <em>any</em> of these environments, and it can be
trickier to do that than it sounds. <strong>The better you phrase your question, the
more appealing it is to answer in the eyes of a high-quality potential source
of advice.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes the advice you receive from multiple sources will be in direct
conflict with each other. I have been having this issue a lot lately. Let&rsquo;s
say one person suggested I do <code>A</code>, and another suggested I do <code>not A</code>. I have
decided this pair of suggestions implies that <em>either</em> decision is just fine,
which is basically the ideal outcome; viz. my so-called &ldquo;significant decision&rdquo;
was not so significant after all and doesn&rsquo;t not need to be balanced
carefully.</p>

<p>Just some biased thoughts from my experience; take some, leave some, etc.</p>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/01/07/the-tone-makes-the-point/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-07T08:40:04-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/01/07/the-tone-makes-the-point</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, hot-shot investor Paul Graham wrote a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html">piece about economic
inequality</a>. This essay provoked a lot of dialogue online. I read the
piece, and a few responses to it. I enjoyed the essay, and I found it very
persuasive. In fact, I would say my &lsquo;opinion on the matter&rsquo; has been changed by
reading the essay and its accompanying summary by the author. The responses I
read were also very interesting. They were from seemingly center-left-wing
individuals like myself, only they were <em>not</em> persuaded by Graham&rsquo;s arguments.</p>

<p>My point here is not so much to discuss the piece, as the tone of the piece.
This piece was written with a tone that raises the hair on the back of the
necks of liberals. This may have been unintentional on the part of Graham,
&hellip;although considering the follow-up discussions of his previous piece on
females in tech, may he just likes raising those particular hairs (they&rsquo;re
called &ldquo;hackles&rdquo;).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I will now summarize what I took from the essay. Technology increases the
potential productivity of people at an exponential rate. Since some people do
not become more productive, this correspondingly increases the <em>variability</em> of
productivity within the population. Those who are more productive in producing
innovative goods are benefitting society. They mainly only are interested in
being more productive <em>because</em> of the possibility of getting rich off of it.
If we want to help the poor, the problem is <em>not</em> that there are rich people;
the problem is that there are poor people. To help the poor, instead of taking
away the ability for the productive to get rich, we should help the poor become
more productive. This is because economic inequality <em>per se</em> is not the issue,
poverty is.</p>

<p>For me, this is, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, both convincing and enlightening. But there
are two concerns any left-winger is almost certainly going to bring up. First,
a lot of people&rsquo;s wealth is not made by being productive in a way that benefits
society; shouldn&rsquo;t we wage class-war against them? Second, even people who
became rich by benefitting society, are likely to abuse their wealth via some
form of corruption, so that&rsquo;s why we should prevent them from getting rich in
the first place. After those two arguments, there are a few other popular
rebuttals. (E.g.) Third, why should we allow some people to be <em>that</em> much
richer than everyone else; something about it seems creepy, therefore it should
be prevented.</p>

<p>These <em>are</em> legitimate concerns, they just don&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> rebut anything
Graham was saying. That&rsquo;s why, if Graham wants to have a legitimate
conversation with people who are going to make the above rebuttals, his
argument should <em>start</em> by saying that those rebuttals are <em>correct</em>, and then
go into how it is <em>still</em> the case that his original arguments are correct. In
this way, the hackles are down, and the legitimate points can be heard.</p>

<p>However, maybe Graham wasn&rsquo;t writing the essay for left-wing people to be
convinced. Maybe he was trying to convince right-wing people. If that is true,
the essay was pointless, because right-wing people <em>already</em> agree with the
opinions he stated. Or maybe he was writing the essay for maximum &ldquo;virality&rdquo; to
increase his fame and international mindshare. In that case, I&rsquo;m not a good
judge of effective argument technique.</p>

    <updated>2016-01-03T21:34:05-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2016/01/03/gamified-learning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have spent the last few days trying to get better at programming. I am no
longer in school, so if I want to learn about, say, compilers, I can&rsquo;t just
sign up for a class on that. There are multiple ways to go about it. It depends
on what you really want to learn and what you want to be able to do with that
knowledge. I have tried various methods of learning over the past few days,
which I have listed below.</p>

<p>What I have noticed of myself is that gamification <strong>works</strong> for me. I love the
satisfaction of (in descending order of [perceived] satisfaction)</p>

<ul>
<li>earning a badge</li>
<li>getting to the next level</li>
<li>beating other humans (directly, or via &ldquo;percentile&rdquo; calculation)</li>
<li>beating robots (similar to &ldquo;beating a boss&rdquo; in a video game)</li>
<li>getting points</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p>Missing from the list below is Coursera, Udacity, etc. After 6 years of school,
I&rsquo;m <em>really</em> of sick of sitting in a lecture hall, even if it&rsquo;s a virtual one.
As a testament to this sentiment, so far I&rsquo;ve read ~150 pages of the Compilers
textbook, which is the book I would be reading were I to take the class at
University. Sometimes I miss having a teacher whose personality I can associate
with the material. This is a bizarre notion, but it is really important. For
me, having a &ldquo;great teacher&rdquo; means someone I want to please by doing well on
the test. Having a &ldquo;bad teacher&rdquo; means I don&rsquo;t care what the teacher thinks of
me, and frankly I want to do badly to make them feel bad. This is a mean way of
looking at the world, and I don&rsquo;t do it consciously, but looking back at how I
approached my classes, this is what I did a lot of the time. Having a &ldquo;great
teacher&rdquo; is an amazing feeling, and an excellent motivator to really dig into
the subject. But I certainly <em>don&rsquo;t</em> miss all the other crap that comes from
having a teacher (even a &ldquo;great&rdquo; one). The main problem with teachers is that
you need to be respectful of their time and the time of the other students in
the class. This leads to a huge amount of wasted time on the part of each
student, because his or her <em>particular</em> questions aren&rsquo;t being answered. I
could go on about that but I won&rsquo;t. The point is, that I really
feel like I understand everything that has happened so far in the 150 pages of
the Compilers book, and it didn&rsquo;t require and physical hand-holding. It is
exceptionally easy to read a book and think you understand it, and actually
<em>not</em> be understanding it. So who knows.</p>

<h3>Here on out</h3>

<p>My first &ldquo;real&rdquo; day of my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; job is tomorrow. So I probably won&rsquo;t be
spending much time just randomly learning whatever I want in the future. But in
general, these are things that I like to learn about, and methods of learning
them that I enjoy doing; so as I find time, I will come back to these things.</p>

<h3>The List</h3>

<p>This list contains bullets for each thing I have tried to learn over the past
few weeks. The sub-bullets contain methods I have used to actually <em>do</em> the
learning. Many of them are gamified methods of learning (e.g. HackerRank).
Others, I have tried to gamify on my own (e.g. using test-driven development).</p>

    <link href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/12/26/first-glimpse-of-compilers/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-26T22:49:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/12/26/first-glimpse-of-compilers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am close to two chapters into &ldquo;Compilers&rdquo; (a.k.a. &ldquo;The Dragon Book&rdquo;), by Aho,
Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. It is an exciting topic to learn about.</p>

<p>The most fundamental thing I have learned so far is the overall pipeline for
understanding the modular components forming the way a compiler is typically
constructed. It goes</p>

<ol>
<li>Lexical analyzer</li>
<li>Syntax analyzer</li>
<li>Semantic analyzer</li>
<li>Intermediate code generator</li>
<li><em>Machine-independent code optimizer</em> (optional)</li>
<li>Code generator</li>
<li><em>Machine-dependent code optimizer</em> (optional)</li>
</ol>


<p>The input to the compiler pipeline is a &ldquo;character stream&rdquo; of the program.
However I don&rsquo;t recall the book ever dealing with specifications of that
stream, except that it supports a generic <code>getchar()</code> operation. I can
understand that if the entire source consists of one file, you just read
character-by-character from the file into the compiler. Maybe the language
designer decides how multiple-file projects are to be read by the compiler,
i.e. it is beyond the scope of this book; or maybe they&rsquo;ll go more in-depth on
this later-on.</p>

<h3>The Lexical Analyzer</h3>

<p>The character stream is read into first component in the compilation pipeline:
the <strong>lexical analyzer</strong>, which maps the <em>character stream</em> into a <em>&ldquo;token&rdquo;
stream</em>. It seems like a <strong>token</strong> knows its <em>tag</em>, and its <em>value</em>. The
<strong>tag</strong> is basically the <em>type</em> of this token in the eyes of the compiler.
Possible tags in their example include <code>NUM</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>[keyword]</code>s, and I added
<code>COMMENT</code> as part of an exercise. The <strong>value</strong> for a token might be the
literal <em>value</em> of a literal; or it might be the name of a variable. More about
that below.</p>

<h4>Symbol Tables</h4>

<p>In addition to creating the token stream, the lexical analyzer builds the
<em>symbol table</em>. It seems to that the <strong>symbol table</strong> maps names to places in
memory. A symbol table also &lsquo;by default&rsquo; implements the language&rsquo;s preferred
form of <em>block scoping</em>. Upon entering a new scope, a new symbol table is
created that points to its &ldquo;parent&rdquo;, the one it is nested inside of. If a
variable is <em>declared</em>, it is added to the symbol table to this scope. Later,
when a variable is <em>referenced</em> (i.e. init&rsquo;d, read, or updated), we will
consult the table for the current innermost scope. If the variable&rsquo;s data is
not found there, we will continue to check ancestors until we find it.</p>

    <updated>2015-12-19T14:05:20-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/12/19/learning-vs-doing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The goal of my first project at my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; job is to get something useful
done within a few days and start to feel like a contributing member of the
team. However it has been about a week, and I still have not finished that
project.</p>

<p>From my experience talking with some of my colleagues so far, their collective
attitude might be summed up with, &ldquo;Google it, then copy-paste it, but don&rsquo;t
worry about what it does.&rdquo; In my life, I have worked with and met <em>many</em> people
having that attitude. Partially because of my experience working with those
people, it happens to decidedly <em>not</em> be <em>my</em> attitude. My attitude is more
like &ldquo;google it, learn what to do, learn why that is the right approach, take
notes, and then copy-paste and modify the best solution to make the final
solution as clean as possible.&rdquo; This strategy got me through many tough
situations, so I have built up faith in it.</p>

<p>So, after seeing me spend <em>days</em> learning about ssh tunnelling, ansible, and
vagrant &mdash; and not finishing my simple project &mdash; they finally said something
along the lines of</p>

<blockquote><p>At this rate it will take you weeks to learn how to automate deployment of a
virtual machine. Why don&rsquo;t you just deploy <em>one</em> copy and then learn about
how to automate it on your <em>own</em> time?</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; is probably an overstatement, but they pointed out to me that I
had sort of assumed out of nowhere that I was hired as some sort of devops role
for the company, even though what I&rsquo;m actually interested in is what one might
call &ldquo;big data engineering&rdquo;. They said, &ldquo;<em>If</em> you find yourself repeating the
same tasks over and over, <em>then</em> you should learn to automate them.&rdquo; It is now
obvious that they are in the right.</p>

<p>At the time, I was startled by the way they approached me about what I consider
to be largely a difference in personalities. But I can see that they are
concerned that someone who reads too much never gets anything done, and so far
I have fit that stereotype. At the same time, I am concerned that a person who
<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> read will do their work quickly and incorrectly and will then spend
the next few weeks rejiggering a broken project, and so far they have fit that
stereotype. In short, it seems that we are all prejudiced and have plenty to
learn from each other.</p>

<p>Going forward I shall take their advice and do the more mundane tasks as fast
as possible and only learn things that come up more than once. If that doesn&rsquo;t
work out for me because I&rsquo;m just cranking out shitty work, I will revert back
to understanding what I am doing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Jetty has <em>cutting edge</em> HTTP/2 support</h3>

<p>For my Wireless Networking project, I&rsquo;m going to compare HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
with respect to performance metrics when talking to a mobile phone over the
cellular network. There are not so many <a href="https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations">implementations</a> of HTTP/2 right
now, and some of them seem a bit shaky. At the end of the day, it seems to me
that the easiest way to run this sort of experiment in a reliable fashion is to
use Java&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> project. It has well-tested HTTP/1.1 support, many
heavyweight framework users, implements HTTP/2&rsquo;s server push and all sorts of
HTTP/2 negotation mechanisms, and I like static types.</p>

<h3>Jetty is hard to find tutorials for</h3>

<p>So I need to learn the basics of Jetty; and there&rsquo;s a lot to learn, and I
haven&rsquo;t found a stellar resource, so I&rsquo;ve been reading the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/embedding-jetty.html">embedded
examples</a>, which are decent. I&rsquo;m usng &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; Jetty because that means
I can write type-safe Java rather than XML. Perhaps XML would be a good choice
for a long-standing app, but I&rsquo;m making a prototype and it&rsquo;s easier to just
write code.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief overview of what I&rsquo;ve learned so far, which may come in handy
for someone else wanting to understand the very basics of Jetty (version 9).
This is not a detailed overview because I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about.
I&rsquo;m just explaining the things I have learned from the tutorial linked above
and some mucking around.</p>

<h3>Jetty has a few large architectural components</h3>

<p>The main things you need to deal with in Jetty are <code>Server</code>s, <code>Handler</code>s, and
<code>Connector</code>s.</p>

<p>The <code>Server</code> manages your entire web site. It does this by connecting
<code>Connector</code>s to <code>Handler</code>s. The default <code>Connector</code>, <code>ServerConnector</code> responds
to vanilla HTTP/1.1 requests. If you try to make a request via <code>https</code> to a
<code>ServerConnector</code> without <code>https</code> support, in Chrome you will see the following
error message</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Unable to make a secure connection to the server. This may be a problem with
</span><span class='line'>the server, or it may be requiring a client authentication certificate that you
</span><span class='line'>don&#39;t have.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Handler</h4>

<p>You may want a chain of <code>Handler</code>s that will be tried one after another until
one is found to be appropriate for handling the current request</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">HandlerList</span> <span class="n">handlers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">HandlerList</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">handlers</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setHandlers</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Handler</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">resource_handler</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DefaultHandler</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>DefaultHandler</code> will simply return <code>404</code>s for everything. Jetty will keep trying <code>Handler</code>s in the list until one of them performs</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">baseRequest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setHandled</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Looking at the <code>DefaultHandler</code>&rsquo;s source, we can see that indeed, in the
<code>handle</code> method, this is the <em>first</em> thing it does.</p>

<h4>Connector</h4>

<p>Each <code>Connector</code> instance can respond to a particular <em>protocol</em> at a
particular <em>host</em> on a particular <em>port</em>. So if you want to respond to <code>https</code>
requests as well as vanilla <code>http</code>, you&rsquo;re going to need another <code>Connector</code>.</p>

<h4>Routing</h4>

<p>A <code>ContextHandler</code> is used to do what in Rails would be called &ldquo;routing&rdquo;. This
is where you associate path&rsquo;s in the HTTP request header to the right
controller. After you&rsquo;ve created your <code>ContextHandler</code>s and set their
<code>contextPath</code>s, you need to do the following</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">Server</span> <span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Server</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">8080</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ContextHandlerCollection</span> <span class="n">contexts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ContextHandlerCollection</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">contexts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setHandlers</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Handler</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">context0</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">context1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="o">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setHandler</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">contexts</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means the server is going to ask the <code>ContextHandlerCollection</code> for the
first <code>ContextHandler</code> that matches the path specified on the incoming request.</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Jetty feels dated compared to Ruby on Rails</h3>

<p>So far, I find Jetty surprisingly nice. I&rsquo;m
starting to appreciate the fact that it is written in Java and it is open
source. It&rsquo;s so different from Ruby on Rails and Node.js because there is not a
lot of magical mystery code running in the background whose source is difficult
to find. The advantage of those other frameworks is that they have much higher
level APIs. I find myself wrapping Jetty methods into my own methods that do
what in Rails would have been done automatically. Now I understand the draw of
Rails&rsquo;s &ldquo;convention over configuration&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t repeat yourself&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t
realize how much configuration and repeating yourself was necessary back in the
Java days. And that leads me to my next point, that writing Jetty feels like
writing 10 year old code. I wasn&rsquo;t coding 10 years ago, but I imagine you had
to explicitly wire every last thing together by hand over and over again, as
you do in Jetty.</p>

<p>Unlike Rails or iOS, basic Jetty is not a Model View Controller framework. It&rsquo;s
just handlers on a server, more like Node.js. Personally, I like MVC out of
ignorance because I assume people who came up with it thought the &ldquo;application
framework&rdquo; way of doing thigs was &lsquo;bad&rsquo;, and I tend to trust people who don&rsquo;t
like the &lsquo;old&rsquo; way of doing things. That said, I am not making a database based
application here so I will not evaluate this difference any further.</p>

    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/intro-to-http-slash-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The problem of HTTP/1.1</h2>

<h3>HTTP/1.1 is from an earlier Web</h3>

<p>For the past several years, Google, Mozilla, Akamai, the IETF, the academic
research community, and others have been engaged in efforts to reduce PLTs
experienced by users of the WWW. One bottleneck in apparent need of an update
is the now-&ldquo;ancient&rdquo; HTTP/1.1 (H1) protocol, published in 1999.</p>

<p>From the beginning, one of the major design goals of the original HTTP protocol
was simplicity to implement and adopt, to encourage growth of the WWW.
Evidently, this technique worked. However, over the past 16 years, the way
people create, distribute, and view pages on the WWW has changed drastically.
Pages today have far more Javascript, CSS, images, and other content to go
along with the vanilla HTML. In the course of this evolution, numerous issues
with H1 have come up, mostly pertaining to the number of sequential round-trips
it requires to fully download the data for each web page. These round-trips
introduce unnecessary latency.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Over the past 16 years, countermeasures, &ldquo;optional&rdquo; protocol alterations, and
application level workarounds have been suggested and implemented to reduce the
round-trip count and therefore latency of pages retrieved using H1.</p>

<h3>HTTP/1.1 PLT Optimizations</h3>

<p>Some optimizations servers and browsers use to lower PLTs seen by clients are
the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Opening multiple TCP connections to request the download of multiple
required web page resources in parallel.</li>
<li>Inlining and concatenating scripts and stylesheets to reduce the number of
requests.</li>
<li><em>HTTP pipelining</em>, in which multiple requests are sent by the browser over a
single TCP connection before waiting for responses to any, then the server
sends all of the responses back in the same order.</li>
</ol>


<p>HTTP pipelining was an idea that did not work out. It seemed like a logical
approach to improve HTTP performance by reducing latency. However, in reality,
HOL blocking became an even greater issue then it already had been, and it also
led to issues with older proxies that are difficult to update. Nowadays, modern
browsers do not enable pipelining.</p>

<h2>HTTP/2 aims to address these issues</h2>

<p>The main reason multiple resources can&rsquo;t be <em>multiplexed</em> (downloaded in
parallel) over a single TCP connection in H1 is because it is an ASCII
protocol. Being an ASCII protocol means that there is no easy way to specify
how to demultiplex those responses with a parser.</p>

<p>To address this, HTTP/2 (H2) is a <em>binary</em> protocol that <em>can</em> easily multiplex
multiple requests and responses through a single TCP connection. It does this
using a new <em>binary framing layer</em>, in which responses are broken into separate
<em>frames</em> and interleaved through the TCP socket.</p>

<p>Web designers have discovered that to yield the best user experience, the
server should transmit certain most-important resources first, as soon as they
are available to send (e.g. loaded from disk). H2 frames (and <em>streams</em>) have
an (optional) <code>priority</code> field to allow the application developer (and server
writer) to bias the ordering of frames sent through the socket. For example,
one may want to ensure that <code>.html</code> files have a higher priority than <code>.jpeg</code>
files because <code>.jpeg</code>s contain a lot of data and are not as crucial for showing
the user a <em>barebones</em> version of the page they requested.</p>

<h3>Brief History</h3>

<p>The current H2 specification (RFC 7540) is based primarily on the SPDY protocol
invented and first used at Google. Google is in a rather unique position to
conduct research on this topic because they write the code running large
proportion of both user&rsquo;s browsers, <em>as well as</em> the servers for a large
portion of the web pages those people visit. This allows them to run real
controlled experimental studies on web traffic, to try to guage the best way to
speed up the Web.</p>

<p>Many have voiced concerns that Google&rsquo;s ideas are welcomed to quickly by the
standards committee. However, supporters are eager to get the ball rolling on
any good ideas, and point to the fact that Google already has <em>results</em>.</p>

<p>Note that some of the experimental results below were actually obtained using
SPDY rather than H2, but we will not concern ourselves with that because they
are the same in essence. Google Chrome still supports SPDY, but has claimed it
will remove support in 2016 so that there are not two competing
standardizations of basically the same protocol.</p>

<p>In reality, in my Chrome browser, using the &ldquo;HTTP/2 and SPDY indicator&rdquo;
extension, I can see that Google&rsquo;s search results and YouTube videos are served
over SPDY/3 running on top of their still-in-research QUIC protocol which is
meant to replace TCP as the transport layer protocol underneath HTTP. The
&ldquo;indicator&rdquo; reveals that many websites are in fact already being served over
H2, including Twitter. I hope to explore what exactly QUIC does, promises, and
delivers further in my research if there is time and space for it.</p>

<h3>Experimental Results</h3>

<p>Experiments investigating relative performance differences between H1 and H2
have yielded contradictory results (Wang et al.). In (Wang et al.), they found
that H2 generally outperforms H1, except when the task is to transmit <em>large</em>
objects over a <em>high-loss</em> connection. One of the goals in defining H2 is that
it is supposed to be easy to swap-in in-place of H1. This finding indicates
that especially with respect to mobile phones, the H1 optimization techniques
of inlining and concatenating web page resources is the wrong way to
improve performance for H2.</p>

<h3>HTTP for Mobile</h3>

<p>With respect to mobile devices, there are multiple problems with HTTP that are
<em>not</em> addressed by H2 (Erman et al.).</p>

<p>First of all, TCP congestion window part of congestion avoidance (<code>cwnd</code> and
<code>ssthresh</code>) makes it so that dropping a single TCP datagram leads to a
drastically reduced throughput. This is because TCP assumes the packet was
dropped due to network congestion, when in reality, it could have been for any
of the wireless-specific issues (multipath propagation, etc.)</p>

<p>Secondly, bad interactions between the 3G &amp; LTE MAC state machine timeouts and
modern default TCP timeouts and mechanisms lead to datagram <em>retransmissions</em>
with further resets on congestion window state variables, resulting in a
drastically negative impact on throughput.</p>

<h3>Research is needed</h3>

<p>From the system administrators&#8217; perspective, it is still difficult to decide
whether enabling H2 on one&rsquo;s servers is going to have a positive impact on
performance <em>at all</em> (Varvello et al.). The following questions still do not
have good enough answers to make answering that decision easy.</p>

<ol>
<li>What changes to the infrastructure and optimization pipeline are needed to
provide a significant benefit over H1?</li>
<li>What are the best algorithms for leveraging H2&rsquo;s new capabilities for
<em>server push</em> and <em>prioritization</em>?</li>
<li>Why do experiments by different research groups yield such a wide disparity
in results?</li>
<li>Are we unlikely to see any real PLT improvements until we improve the
underlying transport layer protocol?</li>
<li>In what ways is the problem different for mobile?

<ul>
<li>What changes need to be made in the mobile-specific scenario, viz. where
interference, low bandwidth, high latency, and battery life
considerations are major concerns?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why is WiFi so slow on the porch?</h2>

<p>The problem at my house is that WiFi connectivity is generally fine inside the
house, but while sitting on the porch it is nearly impossible for anyone to
browse the Hinternets. I think a lesson of my <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/classes/F15-CS386W/">Wireless Networking</a> course
explains this observation.</p>

<p>In Wireless networking we have the situation called the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hidden_node_problem"><strong>Hidden Terminal
Problem</strong></a>, which is the following. Node <code>A</code> is too far from node <code>C</code> to
hear its transmissions, but both are in range of node <code>B</code> which sits between
<code>A</code> and <code>C</code>. Suppose <code>C</code> is currently transmitting data to <code>B</code>. Now <code>A</code> checks
whether any transmissions are currently happening, and finds that there are
none (because it is out of range of <code>C</code>). So <code>A</code> goes ahead and sends data to
<code>B</code>. Now <code>B</code> can&rsquo;t understand either data packet because they collided and
interfered with each other in an unrecoverable way because they were both sent
in the same channel.</p>

<p>I think the porch scenario is simply an example of the <em>Hidden Terminal
Problem</em> above. In my room, my laptop can hear many of my neighbors&#8217; WiFi LAN
networks, but it&rsquo;s the same set that my WiFi router sitting in the closet can
hear. However outside, where there&rsquo;s less cause for signal attenuation, my
laptop can hear many more WiFi LAN networks than the router inside. So the
router checks whether there is congestion, doesn&rsquo;t hear any, and sends the
data. But there <em>is</em>, in fact, congestion, and my computer doesn&rsquo;t receive the
data properly. The data is therefore not <em>ACKd</em>, the router times out on the
<em>ACK</em>, and has to retransmit, and so on. This makes for a <em>far</em> slower
Hinterconnectivity outside on the porch than in my room.</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson learnt is that the WiFi router should be situated in a place
where it can hear more of the outside noise so that it can compensate better
for that noise.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to align a data structure at the nearest word-alignment to a given
starting address, we&rsquo;d must find the smallest multiple of N (a power of 2)
which is greater than or equal to integer X. Is there a way we can <em>make this
fast</em>, i.e. not use division or modulo?</p>

<h2>First Thoughts</h2>

<h3>First of all</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Otherwise, we have two cases</h3>

<h4>First Case</h4>

<pre><code>N: 00100
X: 01100
--------
=&gt; 01100
</code></pre>

<p>This example indicates the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Second Case</h4>

<pre><code>N: 00100       
X: 01101       
--------       
=&gt; 10000       
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be accomplished by</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we have the first-take program of</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<!-- more -->


<h2>Engineering Wisdom</h2>

<p>The above solution is in fact correct <em>(takes a quick bow)</em>.</p>

<p>When I looked up a better answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19450743">StackOverflow</a>, I found a
program that does not use conditionals, and is therefore much faster</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c'><span class='line'><span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">N</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, it was not obvious to me that this program works! Let&rsquo;s peer inside
and see how similar it is to my solution.</p>

<p>First we&rsquo;re going to compute something, and then we&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;and&rdquo; it with
<code>~(N-1)</code>. Well, &ldquo;and&#8221;ing <em>anything</em> against <code>~(N-1)</code> is going to round it down
to a multiple of N. So that part is taken care of.</p>

<p>Now we need to get the <em>right</em> multiple of N. <code>if X &lt; N</code>, then then adding X to
N and rounding down to a multiple N is just going to give us N. That&rsquo;s the
first line of my answer, taken care of.</p>

<p>So <code>if X &gt; N</code>, we either do or don&rsquo;t have bits in place values below N. This is
what my last two lines are taking care of. However, we can deal with this by
noting that after we add X to N, if there are bits in place values below N,
when we subtract 1, it will not change any bits that will survive the &ldquo;and&rdquo;
stage. But if there are no bits in place values below N, then subtracting one
will decrement our answer wrt bits N and higher.</p>

<p>Hmm, not the best explanation of all time. But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on in there.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the remark &ldquo;<code>// alas, sign extension means we must do

<p><code>ol[i]</code> is a <code>byte</code>, i.e. 8 bits. But if you try to subtract two bytes</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x00</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xff</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will produce a <strong>compiler error</strong>, because Java&rsquo;s <code>-</code> (minus) operator
<em>promotes</em> <code>byte</code>s to <code>int</code>s before <em>performing</em> the <code>-</code>, thus <code>-</code> produces an
<code>int</code>, and you can&rsquo;t assign an <code>int</code> to a <code>byte</code> (without a cast, because you&rsquo;d lose bits).</p>

<p>So what about</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x00</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xff</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The problem is that (according to the spec in the doc comment), we want <code>c</code> to
be <em>negative</em>. However note:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// this</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x00</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mh">0xff</span><span class="o">;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So now <code>c = 1</code> instead of <code>-255</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So because of the masking, we avoided sign extension, and now <code>c = -255</code>, which
is what we wanted.</p>

    <updated>2015-09-07T15:45:58-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/09/07/basics-of-wireless-communication</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing the readings for my <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/classes/F15-CS386W/">Wireless Networking course</a> at
UTexas, and in the process have dug into much of the basics of radios and
networks that I had ignored in the past. Here, I will try briefly describe what
I have learned. Maybe not everything I will say here is exactly correct, but I
think it&rsquo;s at least <em>mostly</em> correct.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to start somewhere near the beginning. Our <strong>goal</strong> is to transfer a
<em>information</em> from one location <code>LocSND</code> to another <code>LocRCV</code> <em>conveniently</em>.
The way we will accomplish that is by having <code>LocSND</code> manipulate the
<em>electromagnetic field</em> around <code>LocRCV</code>. More specifically, we will <em>encode</em> a
binary <em>dataframe</em> as <em>modulations</em> of a <em>radio signal</em> around a pre-determined
<em>carrier frequency</em>.</p>

<p>How do we <em>do</em> that?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We use an LRC circuit to make electrons oscillate in an
antenna. These oscillating electrons ram into loose and excitable electrons in
the antenna&rsquo;s metal, this releases a photon at a particular frequency. Globally
(i.e. within the entire transmitting antenna), enough photons are being
released that it seems to an external observer looking at the produced
electromagnetic (EM) field like there is a continuous signal being emitted.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re sending these EM ripples, which are generally at our carrier
frequency. However, if we just sent a basic frequency, there would be no
<em>information</em> in there, so we have to <em>modulate</em> it. We can modulate its
amplitude (A), phase (phi), and frequency (omega), the 3 free
parameters of the equation (in the top left of the equation in the following
gif from &ldquo;sengpielaudio&rdquo;)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.sengpielaudio.com/Sinuskurve01.gif" alt="sine wave" /></p>

<p>This would give us
1. <strong>Carrier frequency</strong> &mdash;&ndash; the EM frequency <em>inside</em> which our signal is
  encoded
2. <strong>amplitude shift keying (ASK)</strong> &mdash; send signal at <em>carrier frequency</em> by
   modulating the signal&rsquo;s <em>amplitude</em>
3. <strong>frequency shift keying (FSK)</strong> &mdash; similar but modulates <em>frequency</em>
4. <strong>phase shift keying (PSK)</strong> &mdash; again, but modulates <em>phase</em></p>

<p>One simple method would be to say our carrier frequency is 5 Hz, but our band
is actually [4,6] Hz. So whenever the signal is 4 Hz, that means I&rsquo;m sending a
0, and if the signal is 6 Hz, it means I&rsquo;m sending a 1, and a new digit starts
every 1 ms. That would be an example of <strong>FSK</strong>.</p>

<p>A fundamental problem that we must solve is that all senders and receivers of
information via EM fields with their antenna(s) are sharing the a single
<em>medium</em> for transmitting that field (viz. the air, etc.). So if <code>LocSND</code> sends
a message to <code>LocRCV_1</code>, then <code>LocRCV_2</code> sitting one foot away can hear that
message loud and clear. This leads to three major issues: <strong>security</strong>,
<strong>multiplexing</strong>, and <strong>interference</strong>.</p>

<p>To <strong>multiplex</strong> means to send multiple distinct signals through a single
channel. How are we going to send distinct signals to receivers 1 and 2 in such
a way that both can understand the signal meant for them? We can chop up the
frequency band that our transmitter can use into 2 smaller bands, and use each
of those bands as separate carriers. Then we tune the receivers to pick up
frequencies in their respective bands. This is what is called <strong>frequency
division multiplexing (FDM)</strong>, but we can also multiplex across space, time,
and <em>code</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve only scratched the very surface of what&rsquo;s going on here, but
that&rsquo;s all the time I&rsquo;ve got.</p>

    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/08/23/a-pattern-in-the-stone-review-and-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>How I Found it</h3>

<p>I was watching a biography of Richard Feynman, and they interviewed this guy W.
Daniel Hillis, and he seemed like a cool dude so I looked him up on Google, and
came across his book, <strong><em>The Pattern in the Stone: The Simple Ideas that Make
Computers Work</em></strong> (1999). On Amazon it was compared to <strong><em>Code: The Hidden
Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em></strong>, by Charles Petzold, an
encredibly well- written book about how computers work. I would gladly read any
book considered comparable in lucidity to <em>Code</em>, so I got <em>The Pattern in the
Stone</em>.</p>

<h3>What it says</h3>

<p>The first few chapters are meant to give a basic understanding of what a
computer is actually doing, and he spends some time noting the Universality of
computers, which he says shows that &ldquo;all computers are alike in what they can
and cannot do&rdquo;. Personally, my intuition of the workings of a computer comes
mainly from an explanation by Richard Feynman himself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA">as seen on the
YouTubes</a>) which is &ldquo;heuristic&rdquo; rather than mechanical. Basically
Feynman gradually turns a human being into a computer, and then talks about how
this mechanistic person can be implemented using logic gates built from water
pipes that he sketches on a whiteboard. In <em>Pattern in the Stone&#8221;</em>, he builds
logic gates out of parallel and series wires, and also out of springs and
pivots.</p>

<p>Then he introduces finite state machines and programming in LOGO. Then he
mentions how machine code can be thought of as <em>control instructions</em>,
specifying the next instruction to fetch and execute, and <em>processing
instructions</em>, moving data to and from memory, and through the Arithmetic Logic
Unit.</p>

<p>Then he starts really getting into what I think is the main point of the book,
to convince the reader that there is no magical process occurring in our brains
that a mechanical computer cannot replicate, meaning that</p>

<blockquote><p>As far as we know, no device built in the physical universe can have any more
computational power than a Turing machine&hellip;[so] a universal computer with
the proper programming should be able to simulate the function of a human
brain.</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>Then he explains a bit about quantum computing. He notes that when a water
molecule is formed, its atoms must &ldquo;know&rdquo;/&ldquo;compute&rdquo; the appropriate angle
between their bonds. Computational approximation methods of determining this
angle are slow, but the water molecule does it &ldquo;almost instantaneously&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>One way of explaining how the water molecule can make the same calculation is
to imagine it trying out every possible configuration simultaneously— in
other words, using parallel processing. Could we harness this simultaneous
computing capability of quantum mechanical objects to produce a more powerful
computer? Nobody knows for sure.</p></blockquote>

<p>He notes that although it would certainly be possible, &ldquo;there is no evidence
whatsoever&rdquo; of the human brain leveraging quantum mechanics in its operation.</p>

<p>Then he defines an algorithm as a procedure for provably solving a problem, and
a heuristic as a rule that <em>tends</em> to get the right answer. Then he uses this
to describe a chess-playing AI using alpha-beta pruning.</p>

<p>After discussing encryption and encodings, he moves on to parallelism. He notes
that a computer analyzing a photo has to look at the image pixel-by-pixel, but
the human brain seems to process the entire photo, even comparing it to
previously seen photos, very quickly, even though neurons themselves are
comparatively slow.</p>

<p>Then he goes into one of those bold claims of an expert that are very fun to
read:</p>

<blockquote><p>As computers on the network begin to exchange interacting programs instead of
just electronic mail, I suspect that the Internet will start to behave less
like a network and more like a parallel computer. I suspect that the emergent
behavior of the Internet will get a good deal more interesting.</p>

<p>As the information available on the Internet becomes richer, and the types of
interaction among the connected computers become more complex, I expect that
the Internet will begin to exhibit emergent behavior going beyond any that
has been explicitly programmed into the system.</p></blockquote>

<p>To me this statement seems vague enough to <em>definitely</em> be true. I would
imagine that already, the interaction between different high-frequency-trading
systems display emergent behaviors, though I have no idea.</p>

<p>Then he gets to machine learning. He notes that computers need three
ingredients for learning: a goal, a measure of how far off they are from that
goal, and a way to reduce that distance. He describes the similarities of
&ldquo;artificial neural networks&rdquo; with the human brain. He mentions that by building
up a multi-layer artificial neural network larger abstractions can be encoded
in the weights connecting the neurons.</p>

<p>Finally, he gets to my favorite part of the book: how to build AI that understands humanity</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe that we may be able create an artificial intelligence long before
we understand natural intelligence, and I suspect that the creation process
will be one in which we arrange for intelligence to emerge from a complex
series of interactions that we do not understand in detail— that is, a
process less like engineering a machine and more like baking a cake or
growing a garden. We will not engineer an artificial intelligence; rather, we
will set up the right conditions under which an intelligence can emerge.</p>

<p>[The practice in systems engineering] of &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; works very
well, but an evolved object like the brain does not necessarily have this
kind of hierarchical structure.</p>

<p>The brain is much more complicated than a computer, yet it is much less prone
to catastrophic failure. The contrast in reliability between the brain and
the computer illustrates the difference between the products of evolution and
those of engineering. A single error in a computer’s program can cause it to
crash, but the brain is usually able to tolerate bad ideas and incorrect
information and even malfunctioning components.</p>

<p>So, in creating an artificial intelligence, what is the alternative to
engineering? One approach is to mimic within the computer the process of
biological evolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>He notes how he created a sorting algorithm that outperformed quicksort by <em>evolving</em> it using sequences of computer instructions. <em>Whoa!</em></p>

<blockquote><p>One of the interesting things about the sorting programs that evolved in my
experiment is that I do not understand how they work. I have carefully
examined their instruction sequences, but I do not understand them.</p>

<p>If the safety of the airplane depended on sorting numbers correctly, I would
rather depend on an evolved sorting program than on one written by a team of
programmers.</p></blockquote>

<p>This book is super cool.</p>

<blockquote><p>I suspect that consciousness is a consequence of the action of normal
physical laws, and a manifestation of a complex computation</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the same conclusion me and some friends reached this past spring at the
end of a weeks-long discussion.</p>

<blockquote><p>but to me this makes consciousness no less mysterious and wonderful— if
anything, it makes it more so. Between the signals of our neurons and the
sensations of our thoughts lies a gap so great that it may never be bridged
by human understanding. So when I say that the brain is a machine, it is
meant not as an insult to the mind but as an acknowledgment of the potential
of a machine. I do not believe that a human mind is less than what we imagine
it to be, but rather that a machine can be much, much more.</p></blockquote>

<p>What a beauty.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>My &ldquo;Learning&rdquo; Workflow</h3>

<p>As I wrote about <a href="http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/how-apm-originally-worked/">before</a>, I have developed an interesting method of learning
from experts, which can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork their repo on GitHub</li>
<li>Clone the repo locally and &ldquo;detach the <code>HEAD</code>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;inital commmit&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now repeat the following <code>while (curious)</code>

<ol>
<li>Open the working tree in an editor/IDE</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s something runnable, run it</li>
<li>Understand everything going on in the working tree

<ul>
<li>Take hints from the commit message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advance <code>HEAD</code> one commit</li>
<li>View the diff from the previous commit</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>SourceTree cannot handle this workload</h3>

<p>I have always used Atlassian&rsquo;s Git GUI called SourceTree for all of my Git
usage because it is a <em>great</em> application, but the fact is, it will not work
for the workflow above. SourceTree has to rebuild the list of commits <em>all the
time</em> (startingfrom the most recent), and when there are thousands of commits,
that can take about a minute. But since I&rsquo;m always operating at the beginning
of the reverse end of the commit log, using SourceTree is untenable. For
whatever reason they decided it was a better idea not to keep all these commits
in memory after they are loaded the first time. I&rsquo;m not saying that was a bad
decision, because my workflow here may be <em>atypical</em>.</p>

<h3>Git is a DAG pointing back in time</h3>

<p>From what I understand&mdash;which is not (yet) a whole lot&mdash;Git is a DAG of
&ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of the state of your project. Each snapshot points to its parents.</p>

<p>In a typical case, you&rsquo;ll load a snapshot, edit your working directory, add the
changes into the staging area, and <strong>commit</strong> a new snapshot which equals the
previous snapshot, plus the staged changes. Now your new commit has <em>one</em>
parent: the previous snapshot.</p>

<p>A <strong>merge commit</strong> would have <strong>two parents</strong>: the previous commit on the
branch being committed to, and the previous commit on the branch being merged-
in.</p>

<h3>The Learning workflow flows the wrong way</h3>

<p>The Learning worflow would require pointers to the <em>next</em> commit, not just
back-pointers. So it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit the Git mold, and we require a
workaround.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where StackOverflow saves the day. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2121230/git-how-to-move-back-and-forth-between-commits/23172256#23172256">Here</a> someone modified
a StackOverflow answer by someone else to a <em>related</em> question, and produced
wrappers that help you traverse back and forth between commits. I reproduce an
explicated and slightly simplified version below which may be added to your
shell config file.</p>

<h3>Wrappin it up</h3>

<p>So yeah, now the workflow is simpler to use and it was made possible by gaining
a better understanding of how Git works.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-06T20:17:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethanp.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/how-apm-originally-worked</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few days I have been learning how <code>apm</code>, the Atom Package Manager
works under the hood. <code>apm</code> is what you use when, in GitHub&rsquo;s (relatively new)
&ldquo;Atom&rdquo; text editor, you go to the nice gui package installation interface under
<code>settings=&gt;packages</code>.</p>

<p>Atom is a &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; text editor built on top of Chromium, using Node.js and
Coffeescript. I believe they call it hackable because all the code is open
source, and you can add plugins to do whatever you want. Your plugins can even
be written in C++ if that&rsquo;s more your style.</p>

<p>My goal was to figure out how <code>apm</code> works, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure how best to do
that. My knowledge of Node.js was minimal, and I was no expert in Coffeescript.
What I decided to do was fork the <code>apm</code> GitHub repo, clone it onto my computer,
and set my local HEAD to the <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/b8f4ce0d0cda458853eb280fde39fdeb2de38ebd">&ldquo;initial commit&rdquo;</a>, and see if I could
understand that. The complete contents are as follows</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>README.md</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'># APM - Atom Package Manager
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Discover and install Atom packages.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this stage I pretty confident that I understood everthing the author Kevin
Sawicki was doing. Lucky for me, it seems Kevin is rather unique on GitHub&rsquo;s
Atom development team for having smaller commits. I can justify this by noting
that on Atom-core&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/graphs/contributors">list of developer contributions</a>, he has 2x more
commits than the next guy, but is not in the top 5 in terms of LOC added.</p>

<p>So with my head fully wrapped around the &ldquo;initial commit&rdquo; I moved my HEAD past
the 2nd commit (a typo fix) into the first commit of any substance, <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/31294702b11061e60214357f4529fb9b00a7068d">&ldquo;Add
initial Gruntfile, binary, and ignores&rdquo;</a>. At this point there was some
investigation to do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I learned how he&rsquo;s setting his default <code>grunt</code> task to
compile his Coffeescript source files from the <code>src</code> directory into a <code>lib</code>
directory to be generated at compile time. I learned the basics of <a href="http://browsenpm.org/package.json">what a
<code>package.json</code> is</a> and what it&rsquo;s basic fields do. And I learned how
<code>require('path')</code> command works by loading the <code>module.exports</code> object of
either the file at the specified path, or in the dependencies, etc. <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html">as
specified here</a>. At this point I was good to go on understanding
the first half-hour of development on this project by mister Sawicki.</p>

<p>Basically, I continued in this manner, covering test-driven-development and
unit-testing using <code>jasmine-node</code>, a primitive API with only two endpoints
using <code>express.js</code> as part of a test-case, test fixtures, asynchronous vs
synchronous I/O APIs in various Node modules, and so on, and in the process
learned how <code>apm</code> originally <em>worked</em>.</p>

<h3>How APM originally worked</h3>

<p>It basically just wraps the normal <code>npm</code> command to pull from a different
registry set up presumably by Mr. Sawicki. An <code>npm</code> registry is a CouchDB
instance, where module names, versions, and other metadata are mapped to the
relevant gzipped-tarball.</p>

<p>At first, there was a bit of complicated code where <code>apm</code> was downloading and
installing <code>node</code>, <code>npm</code>, and <code>node-gyp</code> itself, but eventually, these last two
were just <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm/commit/aa480a05e52d14baf56c06517826babd17ae4182">added as dependencies</a>. This involved an
<a href="https://github.com/caolan/async#waterfalltasks-callback"><code>async.waterfall</code></a> which to my naive judgement about such a simple
script seemed to be a bit of overkill.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed was that a <em>lot</em> of the more complicated bits tended to
disapear over time, getting replaced by packages (e.g. <code>wrench</code>, <code>rimraf</code>,
etc.) or replaced by finding a simpler way to do the same thing (like passing
the appropriate command line option to the underlying <code>npm</code>).</p>

<p>It has felt, watching the first stage of this project come together, like I
have been able to peer over the shoulder of a far superior coder as he writes
what eventually has come to be one of the <a href="http://qr.ae/RA68mn">main selling points</a> of the
Atom text editor itself. I have learned countless lessons. It is like that
tutorial that he never had the chance to write. When someone writes a tutorial
they generally are nervous and keep trying to explain the same thing in
different ways and it never quite makes sense. When someone is writing a
significant piece of a public work, they are strictly getting down to business.
Kevin may not have expected anyone to come along and piece through his thought
process, but he left it out on the table anyway and I just grabbed it.</p>

<p>I will continue to go through this git history to find out what happens in the
next chapter. I will also keep this in mind for the future as a way to find out
how something was made. I&rsquo;ve got my eye in particular on watching Linus write
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290">git itself</a>.</p>
